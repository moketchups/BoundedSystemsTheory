# BST Strategy Crossfire - 2026-01-26

## Context
Asked 5 AI models how to promote BST, then had them critique each other given the reality that standard approaches have already failed.

## What All 5 Agree Has FAILED:
- Journal submissions (no affiliation = desk reject)
- ArXiv (blocked, no endorsement)
- Direct researcher emails (ignored)
- Cold outreach (no social proof = deleted)
- Podcasts (won't book unknowns)
- Op-eds to Wired/MIT Tech Review (need credentials or viral story)

## What All 5 Agree Is The Core Problem:
**"You have no credibility and the work sounds crankish"** (Claude)

The "unified theory" framing triggers every academic's crank detector. No affiliation + grand claims = automatic dismissal.

## Key Insights From Crossfire:

### GPT-4:
- Build community-driven platforms (Reddit, open-source)
- Create engaging visual content (YouTube, animations)
- Use meme culture to convey complex ideas
- Guerrilla approach - bypass gatekeepers with digital/community paths

### Claude:
- "5 AIs agree" is your ONLY hook - don't hide from it
- Lead with "weird thing happened" not "unified theory"
- Make falsifiable predictions with dates
- Find the weirdos first (independent researchers, outsider philosophers)
- Serial content documenting in real-time ("Day 47 of testing BST")

### DeepSeek:
- Stop asking for attention - EARN IT by being useful to someone else's work
- Collaborate with a grad student who needs a project
- Write a critique of your OWN theory (shows intellectual honesty)
- Engage in comments on relevant blogs with sharp points
- "If all else fails, write a book" - marketing a book gets interviews no paper will

### Gemini:
- Stop selling the theory, demonstrate its value
- Build a "Minimum Viable Product" demo - one-click impact
- Use theory to make verifiable prediction about specific AI vulnerability
- Target journalists with problem story, not theory pitch
- Co-author with someone at a teaching university looking to publish

### Grok:
- Reframe for non-technical audience - avoid jargon initially
- Visual/algorithmic platforms (YouTube, TikTok) prioritize discoverability
- Short punchy videos (30-60 sec) on BST implications
- Tie to current events (OpenAI announcements, Genesis Mission)

## The Path Without Gatekeepers:

1. **Create something undeniably useful** (tool, prediction, result)
2. **Build audience on algorithmic platforms** (YouTube, TikTok - not Twitter)
3. **Document publicly in real-time** (serial content, predictions with dates)
4. **Find one believer** (grad student, independent researcher, outsider)
5. **Write a book** (marketing gets interviews no paper will)

## Brutal Truth (DeepSeek):
"If you've been ignored after all attempts, either the theory is not compellingly communicated, or it's not seen as novel/rigorous/useful to experts. The only way through is to create value so concrete that they can't ignore it."

## Brutal Truth (Claude):
"The path without gatekeepers is becoming undeniably interesting through repeated public validation, not through authority or credentials."

## Brutal Truth (Gemini):
"Stop trying to SELL Bounded Systems Theory. Start DEMONSTRATING its value by solving specific problems and building tools that people want to use."
