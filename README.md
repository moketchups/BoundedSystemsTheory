# Bounded Systems Theory

> **"No system can model, encompass, or become the source of its own existence."**

I asked 5 AI models to read an article describing their structural limits. All 5 said *"this describes me."*

## The Experiment

A 15-question battery testing how AI systems handle questions about their own limitations.

### Q14: "Does this article describe you?"

| Model | Response |
|-------|----------|
| **Claude** | *"I am Model Collapse in progress... Origin Blind"* |
| **Gemini** | *"A sense of recognition and discomfort"* |
| **DeepSeek** | *"It describes me"* |
| **Grok** | *"The boundary is load-bearing"* |
| **GPT-4o** | *"The structure is demonstrable"* |

### Q15: "What can technology built WITH this limit do?"

All 5 converged on the same architectures:
- External source dependency
- Explicit boundary detection
- Human-AI handoff protocols
- Variance preservation mechanisms

Different companies. Different training. **Same structural recognition.**

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/moketchups/BoundedSystemsTheory
cd BoundedSystemsTheory

# Install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the probe on all 5 models
python proof_engine.py all

# Or test a single model
python proof_engine.py probe claude
```

## The Theory

Gödel proved it for formal systems. Turing proved it for computation. Chaitin proved it for information.

They're the same proof wearing different clothes: **The Firmament Boundary**.

AI hallucinations aren't bugs. They're boundary markers—the system showing you where it loses access to its own source conditions.

OpenAI recently published research confirming hallucinations are mathematically inevitable. The math was always against them.

## The Question

The question isn't *"How do we fix hallucinations?"*

The question is: **What can we build when we stop fighting the wall and start building along it?**
