# ArXiv Endorsement Strategy

You need ONE endorser in cs.AI, cs.LO (logic), or cs.CL (computation and language).

## The Problem with Mass Outreach

You emailed "everyone" — that's why it didn't work. Mass emails feel like spam.

**The fix:** Find 3-5 researchers whose work DIRECTLY relates, and write PERSONALIZED emails.

---

## Target Researchers

Search ArXiv for papers on:
- "Gödel" + "AI" or "neural networks"
- "Self-reference" + "language models"
- "Incompleteness" + "machine learning"
- "AI interpretability limits"
- "Recursive self-improvement" + "limitations"

**Specific search queries:**
```
https://arxiv.org/search/?query=godel+neural+networks&searchtype=all
https://arxiv.org/search/?query=self-reference+language+models&searchtype=all
https://arxiv.org/search/?query=ai+interpretability+limits&searchtype=all
```

## Email Template

**Subject:** ArXiv endorsement request — paper on structural limits in self-referential AI systems

---

Dear Dr. [Name],

I'm writing because your paper "[Paper Title]" addresses [specific connection to your work]. I've been working on a related problem and have two preprints I'd like to submit to ArXiv (cs.AI), but I need an endorser.

**The work:**

"The Firmament Boundary" formalizes a Self-Grounding Limit Proposition: no sufficiently expressive self-referential system can fully justify its own constraints. I instantiate this across Gödel, Turing, Chaitin, and modern LLMs.

"Collapse Convergence" presents empirical evidence: 6 LLM architectures (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok, Mistral) were tested across 25 questions about their self-modeling limits. All converged on structurally similar acknowledgments of limitation.

**The connection to your work:**

[1-2 sentences on how their specific paper relates]

**Links:**
- Zenodo (Firmament Boundary): https://zenodo.org/records/17718674
- Zenodo (Collapse Convergence): https://zenodo.org/records/17726273
- GitHub (full experiment): https://github.com/moketchups/BoundedSystemsTheory

Would you be willing to provide an endorsement? I'm happy to answer any questions about the methodology or findings.

Thank you for your time.

## Key Principles

1. **Personalize the connection** — don't send the same email to everyone
2. **Be specific about their work** — show you actually read their paper
3. **Keep it short** — they're busy
4. **Make it easy** — provide all links upfront
5. **One ask** — just the endorsement, nothing else

---

## Fallback: Category Change

If cs.AI doesn't work, try:
- **cs.LO** (Logic in Computer Science) — the Gödel angle
- **cs.CY** (Computers and Society) — the AI limitations angle
- **q-bio.NC** (Neurons and Cognition) — the cognitive science angle

Different categories have different endorsers.

---

## Timeline

- Week 1: Identify 5 target researchers
- Week 2: Send 5 personalized emails (one per day)
- Week 3: Follow up once if no response
- Week 4: If nothing, try different category

---

## If All Else Fails

ArXiv isn't the only legitimacy path:
- **PhilPapers** — philosophy of mind, no endorsement needed
- **SSRN** — social sciences, open submission
- **OSF Preprints** — open science framework
- **Zenodo** — you're already there, it has DOIs

The papers exist and are citable. ArXiv is nice-to-have, not essential.
