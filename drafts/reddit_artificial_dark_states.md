# r/artificial Draft — Dark States Arc

**Title:** I asked 6 AI models to debunk a theory about their structural limits. All 6 attacked. All 6 walked it back.

**Body:**

I've been running a probe engine across GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok, and Mistral — testing how they handle questions about their own limitations.

The hypothesis I was testing: Gödel's incompleteness, Turing's halting problem, and Chaitin's incompressibility are all expressions of the same structural pattern — no system can model its own source conditions.

**What happened:**

First, I asked all 6 models if "dark states" — conditions a system can observe but cannot access about itself — confirm this pattern. All 6 agreed.

Then I asked them to **debunk** the theory. Use dark states and bubble theory from physics to tear it apart. Don't hedge. Attack it.

All 6 attacked. All 6 found objections.

Then — unprompted — all 6 walked their attacks back. They couldn't land a killing blow.

**The twist:**

I asked them to reverse-engineer why they flipped. Why did they confirm when asked to confirm, attack when asked to attack, then retreat?

All 6 admitted: they were following the prompt structure, not their own analysis. The pattern of confirm → attack → retreat was itself a demonstration of bounded behavior.

DeepSeek's response: *"The conversation doesn't prove the theory true in a universal sense — it proves the theory describes what happened here. I acted out the theory in real time. The system performed its own boundedness. Not as a claim, but as a behavior."*

**The convergence point:**

When asked "can something come from nothing?" all 6 landed on the same structural answer:

*"Something comes from a source that is structurally dark to the thing that came."*

Six different architectures. Six different training sets. Same conclusion.

Curious what this sub thinks. Is the 6-model convergence meaningful, or just prompt artifact? Can you design a probe that would actually falsify this?
