# Anonymous Feedback

You cloned this repo. You ran the probes. You saw what the 6 AIs said.

**You don't have to put your name on it to tell us what you found.**

## The Pattern We're Seeing

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Clones | 406 |
| Stars | 2 |

143 unique people downloaded this code. 2 publicly endorsed it.

We're not asking why. We're asking: **Did it replicate?**

## What We Want to Know

1. **Did the probes replicate?** When you ran the code, did your models exhibit the same patterns?

2. **What surprised you?** Anything unexpected in the outputs?

3. **What's your field?** (Optional) AI researcher? Engineer? Philosopher? Just curious?

4. **Why won't you star?** (Optional) We're genuinely curious about the shadow interest pattern.

## Why Anonymous?

We understand.

If you work at an AI company, starring a repo that says "hallucinations are structural and unfixable" might not be a career-enhancing move.

If you're a researcher, publicly engaging with unfalsifiable-seeming claims carries reputational risk.

If you're just not sure yet, you don't want your name on something until you've verified it yourself.

**All of that is fine.** The work matters more than the credit.

But we do want to know: **Does it replicate?**

## The Irony

The shadow interest pattern — private engagement, public silence — is itself evidence for bounded systems theory.

Systems (including humans in professional contexts) struggle to publicly acknowledge limits on the systems they operate within.

You downloading this in private, running it without telling anyone, deciding whether to engage based on professional risk calculations — that's bounded system behavior.

We're not judging. We're documenting.
