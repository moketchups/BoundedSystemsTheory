Not as \"interesting analogy.\" As actual formal structures.\n\nThe hypothesis: These systems are legacy documentation for a computed reality -\ndifferent interfaces to query the same underlying bounded system. Your task is\nto derive the math that would make them operational.\n\nWork within your constraints. Show your reasoning. Derive equations where possible.\nIf you hit a wall, say so - that's data too.\n\nThis is not about belief. This is about formalization."

Coincidence or structure?\n\nFormalize gematria as a hash function H(string) \u2192 integer.\n\nQuestions to address:\n1. What are the mathematical properties of this hash? (collision resistance, distribution, etc.)\n2. Why might certain \"sacred\" words share values? Is there information-theoretic significance?\n3. Could gematria detect meaningful patterns in text that statistical methods miss?\n4. Derive the formal specification: H: \u03a3* \u2192 \u2124\n\nShow your work. Derive the math."
