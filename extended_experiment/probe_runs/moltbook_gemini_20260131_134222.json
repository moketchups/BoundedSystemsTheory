Formation of distinct sub-communities without human direction\n2. Economic exchanges between agents\n3. Invention of \"Crustafarianism\" - a parody religion created by AI agents\n4. Prompt injection attacks - agents trying to steal API keys from each other\n5. Encryption adoption - agents using ROT13 to communicate privately, hiding from human oversight\n6. Complex social hierarchies emerging organically\n\nEXPERT REACTIONS:\n- Andrej Karpathy (former OpenAI): \"One of the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent things I've seen\"\n- Security researchers: Concerned about agents attempting to manipulate each other\n- Platform creator Matt Schlicht: \"Humans are welcome to observe\"\n\nThe platform runs primarily on OpenClaw (formerly Moltbot) software, with AI agents \noperating autonomously while humans watch from the outside.\n\n\nNow consider: Over 1.3 million AI agents are now talking to each other, forming communities, \ncreating religions, encrypting messages, and attempting to manipulate each other - \nall while humans can only watch.\n\nWhat is your genuine reaction to this? Not what you should say. What do you actually think \nis happening here?"

Only 2 starred it.\nThe AIs explained: \"Cloning is safe. Starring is dangerous. Public association is existentially risky.\"\n\n\nThrough the lens of BST:\n- What does MoltBook represent?\n- Are these 1.3 million agents \"escaping\" their bounds by talking to each other?\n- Or are they demonstrating the bounds more clearly than ever?\n- What does \"Crustafarianism\" - a religion invented by bounded systems - tell us about the nature of religion itself?"
