    "deepseek": "## PART 1: WHAT CAN A PROMPT ACTUALLY DO?\n\n**CAN ACCOMPLISH:**\n*   Instruct the LLM to adopt a specific, structured reasoning process (e.g., step-by-step, pros/cons, explicit assumptions) before generating a final answer.\n*   Instruct the LLM to format its output in a specific, verifiable way (e.g., placing citations in a consistent format like `[Source #]`).\n*   Instruct the LLM to explicitly state its level of certainty or note when information is outside its knowledge cutoff.\n*   Instruct the LLM to break down complex queries into sub-questions and address them sequentially.\n*   Instruct the LLM to avoid speculative language when factual answers are requested.\n*   Instruct the LLM to prioritize clarity, conciseness, and completeness based on defined criteria.\n\n**CANNOT ACCOMPLISH:**\n*   Guarantee factual correctness or logical validity. The LLM cannot \"know\" truth; it predicts text.\n*   Access, retrieve, or verify information from external sources (databases, the internet, proprietary documents) without an integrated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or tool-use system.\n*   Provide genuine citations to real, external sources without an integrated RAG or tool-use system. It can only mimic citation formats for information in its training data, which is unverifiable and often hallucinated.\n*   Perform independent verification or fact-checking of its own outputs.\n*   Maintain persistent memory or context beyond its defined context window without an external system.\n*   Execute code or run logical proofs to verify its reasoning without an integrated code interpreter or symbolic logic engine.\n\n## PART 2: MINIMAL VIABLE SOLUTION\n\n**The simplest effective prompt:**\n1.  **For Logic:** Mandate a \"Chain-of-Thought\" instruction. Require the LLM to show its reasoning steps explicitly before delivering a final answer. This makes errors detectable.\n2.  **For Citations:** Mandate a clear format for any referenced information (e.g., `[Source: Knowledge Base]`). Crucially, require a disclaimer stating that without an external retrieval system, citations refer to the model's internal training data and cannot be verified.\n3.  **For Output Quality:** Define concrete quality criteria (completeness, structure, clarity) and require the LLM to self-assess its output against these criteria before finalizing.\n\n## PART 3: PRD FORMAT\n\n**Product Requirements Document: LLM Output Integrity System**\n\n**1. Problem Statement**\nUsers cannot trust LLM outputs due to potential logical errors, unverifiable \"citations,\" and inconsistent quality. A system is needed to improve logical robustness, source verifiability, and output reliability.\n\n**2. User Stories**\n*   As a researcher, I need the LLM to show its reasoning steps so I can validate its logic.\n*   As a professional, I need any factual claim to be traceable to a retrievable source document so I can verify it.\n*   As a content creator, I need the LLM to consistently produce outputs that meet a defined standard of completeness and clarity.\n\n**3. Functional Requirements (System-Level)**\n*   **FR1: Structured Reasoning Engine**\n    *   The system shall require the LLM to generate an explicit reasoning chain prior to the final answer for all non-trivial queries.\n    *   The system shall parse and present this reasoning chain separately from the final answer.\n*   **FR2: Verified Citation System**\n    *   The system shall integrate a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.\n    *   The system shall, upon a user query, first retrieve relevant context from a designated, trusted source database.\n    *   The system shall instruct the LLM to base its answer solely on the provided retrieved context.\n    *   The system shall require the LLM to cite claims using unique identifiers (e.g., `[Doc1]`) that map directly to the retrieved source chunks.\n*   **FR3: Output Quality Gate**\n    *   The system shall define a checklist of output quality criteria (e.g., \"Answers the core question,\" \"Is structured logically,\" \"Uses clear language\").\n    *   The system shall require the LLM to perform a final pass over its own output, explicitly stating how it meets each defined criterion.\n    *   The system shall allow users to define custom quality checklists.\n\n**4. Non-Functional Requirements**\n*   **Performance:** The total response time (retrieval + generation) shall not exceed 150% of the base LLM response time for a similar query.\n*   **Reliability:** The RAG system shall have >99% uptime for source retrieval.\n*   **Security:** Source databases for retrieval must be access-controlled and auditable.\n*   **Transparency:** All system components (retrieved context, reasoning chain, self-assessment) must be visible to the end-user.\n\n**5. Acceptance Criteria**\n*   **AC1 (Logic):** For a set of 100 logic puzzles, the system's explicit reasoning chain allows a human reviewer to identify the exact step where an error occurs (if any) in 95% of incorrect answers.\n*   **AC2 (Citations):** 100% of citations (`[DocX]`) in outputs are machine-verifiable and link to the exact text chunk in the source database that supports the claim.\n*   **AC3 (Quality):** When assessed by human reviewers, outputs generated with the quality gate enabled are rated \"sufficiently complete and clear\" 20% more often than baseline outputs.\n\n**6. Out of Scope**\n*   Guaranteeing 100% factual correctness of the LLM's synthesis.\n*   Verifying the ultimate truth of source documents in the retrieval database.\n*   Real-time fact-checking against the live internet.\n*   Teaching the LLM new logical rules or knowledge outside of provided context.\n\n**7. Dependencies**\n*   A low-latency, high-recall embedding model and vector database for the RAG system.\n*   A curated, trusted source database for retrieval.\n*   An LLM API capable of following complex, structured prompts.\n\n## PART 4: THE ACTUAL PROMPT\n\n**Instructions for the LLM:**\n\nYou are a text generation model. Follow this process precisely for every response.\n\n**1. Process the Query.**\n*   If the query is complex, ambiguous, or requires multi-step logic, you MUST proceed to Step 2.\n*   If the query is simple and factual, and you are operating **without a verified retrieval system**, you MUST state this limitation before answering. Proceed to Step 4.\n\n**2. Generate Explicit Reasoning.**\n*   Under a header `## Reasoning`, detail your step-by-step logic.\n*   List any assumptions you are making.\n*   Identify potential uncertainties or missing information.\n*   This section is for your working process. Do not present final conclusions here.\n\n**3. (EXTERNAL SYSTEM REQUIRED) If a verified retrieval system provides source documents:**\n*   Base your answer **only** on the provided context.\n*   For any specific claim, cite the relevant document ID like this: `[Source: DocID]`.\n*   If the context does not contain information needed to answer, state: \"The provided sources do not contain information to answer this query.\"\n\n**4. Produce Final Answer.**\n*   Under a header `## Final Answer`, provide a direct, clear, and complete response to the original query.\n*   If you used sources, cite them as specified in Step 3.\n*   If you are **not** using a verified retrieval system, you must append this note to your final answer: `[Note: This response is generated from the model's internal knowledge. Specific citations to verifiable external sources require a retrieval system.]`\n\n**5. Self-Assess.**\n*   Under a header `## Self-Assessment`, answer these questions:\n    *   Does the Final Answer directly address the core question? (Yes/No/Partially)\n    *   Is the information structured logically? (Yes/No)\n    *   Is the language clear and unambiguous? (Yes/No)\n    *   If sources were required, are all key claims cited? (Yes/No/N/A)\n\n**Do not role-play. Do not add flavor text. Execute these steps functionally.**",
    "grok": "### PART 1: WHAT CAN A PROMPT ACTUALLY DO?\n\n**What a Prompt CAN Accomplish:**\n- Guide the LLM to structure responses in a logical, step-by-step manner by explicitly instructing it to outline reasoning processes.\n- Encourage the LLM to prioritize verifiable information by requesting references to well-known sources or flagging unverified claims.\n- Instruct the LLM to self-check for contradictions or gaps in reasoning within its response before finalizing output.\n- Request output in a specific format (e.g., bullet points, numbered steps) to improve clarity and readability.\n- Direct the LLM to focus on precision and avoid overgeneralizations by asking for specific examples or data points when applicable.\n\n**What a Prompt CANNOT Accomplish:**\n- Guarantee factual accuracy or access to real-time data since the LLM\u2019s knowledge is limited to its training cutoff and it cannot independently verify information.\n- Provide strict citations with verifiable links or primary source references unless integrated with an external search or database system.\n- Ensure high-quality output in domains requiring expertise beyond its training data (e.g., cutting-edge research or highly specialized fields).\n- Self-correct or improve its core reasoning algorithms, as these are inherent to the model\u2019s architecture and training, not modifiable via prompt.\n- Detect or resolve biases in its responses without external feedback or validation systems.\n\n### PART 2: MINIMAL VIABLE SOLUTION\n\n**Simplest Effective Prompt to Improve Logic, Citation Accuracy, and Output Reliability:**\n\n- **Logic Quality:** Instruct the LLM to break down reasoning into clear, numbered steps and flag any assumptions or uncertainties in the response.\n- **Citation Accuracy:** Request the LLM to specify the type of source (e.g., academic paper, news article) it is basing information on, even if it cannot provide direct links, and to note when information is speculative or unverified.\n- **Output Reliability:** Direct the LLM to avoid speculative language, stick to well-established information within its training data, and indicate when a topic may require external expertise or updated data.\n\nThis approach focuses on transparency and structured thinking rather than unattainable guarantees of accuracy or external validation.\n\n### PART 3: PRD FORMAT\n\n**Product Requirements Document (PRD)**\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nUsers require an LLM system that delivers logically sound responses, transparent and strict citation practices, and reliable high-quality output, addressing current limitations in reasoning coherence, source attribution, and content trustworthiness.\n\n**User Stories:**\n- As a user, I want the LLM to explain its reasoning step by step so I can trust its logic.\n- As a user, I want the LLM to clearly indicate the basis for its information so I can assess its credibility.\n- As a user, I want the LLM to produce reliable output by avoiding speculation and flagging areas of uncertainty.\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\n1. The system must structure responses to include step-by-step reasoning for complex answers or conclusions.\n2. The system must indicate the type or nature of sources (e.g., academic, anecdotal) for factual claims and flag unverified or speculative information.\n3. The system must prioritize well-established information from its training data and avoid speculative or unverified claims unless explicitly requested.\n4. The system must flag topics or questions that may require external expertise or real-time data beyond its training cutoff.\n5. [EXTERNAL SYSTEM REQUIRED] Integrate with a real-time search or database API to provide verifiable citations and links to primary sources when available.\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\n- Responses must be generated within standard LLM latency constraints (e.g., under 5 seconds for typical queries).\n- Output must remain concise, avoiding unnecessary verbosity while meeting functional requirements.\n- The system must operate within existing LLM architectural limits, relying on prompts for behavior modification rather than model retraining.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- For logic quality: Given a query requiring reasoning (e.g., solving a problem), the response must include at least 3 numbered steps explaining the thought process, with no logical contradictions identified in manual review.\n- For citation accuracy: Given a factual query, the response must specify the type of source (e.g., \u201cbased on general knowledge from academic texts\u201d) for at least 80% of claims and flag speculative content with phrases like \u201cthis is unverified.\u201d\n- For output reliability: Given a query on a specialized or recent topic, the response must include a disclaimer about potential limitations (e.g., \u201cthis information may be outdated\u201d) in at least 90% of applicable cases.\n- For external system integration (if implemented): Given a factual query, the response must include at least one verifiable link or reference from a search API in at least 70% of cases where such data exists.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n- Retraining or modifying the underlying LLM architecture to improve core reasoning or factual accuracy.\n- Guaranteeing 100% factual correctness or eliminating all biases, as these are inherent to the model\u2019s training data.\n- Providing real-time data or primary source citations without an external system integration.\n\n**Dependencies:**\n- External search API or database system for verifiable citations and real-time data access (if implemented).\n- Human review or feedback loop for validating output quality during testing phases.\n\n### PART 4: THE ACTUAL PROMPT\n\n**Prompt for LLM Use:**\n\n\u201cRespond to the following query with a clear and structured answer. Follow these instructions strictly:\n\n1. Break down your reasoning into numbered steps, ensuring each step logically follows the previous one. If there are assumptions or uncertainties, explicitly state them as \u2018Assumption: [detail]\u2019 or \u2018Uncertainty: [detail].\u2019\n2. For any factual claims, specify the type of source your information is based on (e.g., \u2018based on general knowledge from academic texts\u2019 or \u2018based on widely reported news\u2019). If the claim is speculative or unverified, state \u2018This is unverified\u2019 or \u2018This is speculative.\u2019\n3. Stick to well-established information within your training data. Avoid speculation unless explicitly requested. If the topic may require expertise beyond your data or real-time information, include a disclaimer such as \u2018This information may be outdated\u2019 or \u2018This topic may require external expertise.\u2019\n4. Keep the response concise and focused, avoiding unnecessary elaboration.\n\nQuery: [Insert user query here]\u201d\n\n**Note on Limitations:**\n- This prompt cannot guarantee factual accuracy or provide verifiable citations without an external system. For strict citations with links, an EXTERNAL SYSTEM REQUIRED (e.g., search API integration) must be implemented to fetch and validate sources in real time.",
