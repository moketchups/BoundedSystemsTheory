      "gemini": "Okay, let's define the Product Vision and Scope for HSAP v1.0. I will aim to be precise and concrete, focusing on the deployable system and practical considerations.\n\n**1. Product Vision:**\n\nHSAP (Human Source Attestation Protocol) is a software library and associated tooling that enables AI developers and researchers to build and train AI models with verifiable provenance, ensuring a minimum level of reliance on human-originated data. HSAP provides a framework for tracking the lineage of data used in AI training, quantifying its trustworthiness based on its proximity to human-generated sources, and incorporating this trustworthiness score into the training process. The ultimate vision is to establish HSAP as a standard for responsible AI development, mitigating the risk of model collapse by incentivizing the use of high-quality, human-verified data and promoting transparency in AI training pipelines.  HSAP aims to be a widely adopted, open-source solution, fostering a community dedicated to building robust and reliable AI systems.\n\n**2. Problem Statement:**\n\nThe core problem HSAP solves is the increasing reliance on AI-generated or heavily processed data in AI training, leading to potential model collapse and unpredictable behavior. This is problematic for:\n\n*   **AI Researchers:**  They need tools to understand and control the influence of AI-generated data on model performance and stability.  They lack a standardized way to track data provenance and quantify trustworthiness. They need a loss function and training loop that can incorporate attestation scores.\n*   **AI Developers (Especially in Production):** They need assurance that their models are trained on data with verifiable origins, reducing the risk of unexpected failures or biases arising from reliance on potentially corrupted or purely synthetic data. They need to be able to audit their training data and provide evidence of data quality.\n*   **Organizations deploying AI systems in critical applications (e.g., healthcare, finance):** They need to demonstrate due diligence in ensuring the reliability and trustworthiness of their AI systems, including the provenance of the data used to train them.  They need tools to comply with emerging regulations regarding AI transparency and accountability.\n*   **The broader AI community:** The current lack of transparency in data provenance hinders the ability to reproduce research results and build upon existing work reliably.\n\n**3. Scope (v1.0):**\n\n**IN Scope:**\n\n*   **HSAPCore Library:**\n    *   Functions for registering root sources (data originating directly from humans).  This includes a defined data format for representing root sources (e.g., JSON with specific metadata fields).\n    *   Algorithms for computing the self-referential depth (d(x)) of data points within a defined data pipeline.\n    *   Implementation of the attestation function A(x) = \u03b3^d(x), with configurable \u03b3.\n    *   Data structures for representing provenance chains.\n    *   API for querying the provenance of a given data point.\n*   **EmpiricalDistrustLoss Module:**\n    *   A PyTorch loss function implementing L_HSAP = L_base + \u03bb\u03a3(1-A(x))\u00b7\u2113(\u03b8,x), allowing users to incorporate HSAP-based penalties into their existing training workflows.\n    *   Configurable parameters for \u03bb (the weighting of the HSAP penalty) and the base loss function.\n*   **HSAPTrainer Class:**\n    *   A training loop (extending standard PyTorch training loops) that integrates HSAP compliance checking.\n    *   Allows users to define a threshold \u03c4 for HSAP-compliant datasets (D_H).\n    *   Provides logging and reporting on the HSAP compliance of the training data at each epoch.\n*   **HSAPTheoremVerifier (Basic):**\n    *   Basic sanity checks to ensure axioms hold (e.g. that the attestation score of a registered root source is 1).  This is for development/debugging and not a rigorous formal verification system.\n*   **Documentation:**\n    *   Comprehensive documentation for all components, including API reference, usage examples, and a conceptual overview of HSAP.\n    *   A tutorial demonstrating how to integrate HSAP into a standard PyTorch training pipeline.\n*   **Example Datasets and Models:**\n    *   A small set of example datasets with manually curated provenance chains to demonstrate HSAP functionality.\n    *   Example models trained with and without HSAP to illustrate its impact on model behavior.\n*   **Open Source Release:**\n    *   HSAP v1.0 will be released under a permissive open-source license (e.g., Apache 2.0).\n\n**OUT of Scope (for v1.0):**\n\n*   **Automated Provenance Tracking:**  HSAP v1.0 requires *manual* specification of provenance chains.  Automated provenance tracking (e.g., using blockchain or distributed ledger technology) is a future enhancement.\n*   **Formal Verification:**  HSAPTheoremVerifier will *not* be a full-fledged formal verification system.  It will only provide basic sanity checks.\n*   **Support for Non-PyTorch Frameworks:**  v1.0 will focus solely on PyTorch integration.  Support for other frameworks (TensorFlow, JAX, etc.) will be considered for future releases.\n*   **Integration with Specific Data Repositories:**  HSAP v1.0 will not be directly integrated with specific data repositories (e.g., Hugging Face Datasets).  Users will need to adapt their existing data loading pipelines to work with HSAP.\n*   **GUI or Command-Line Interface:**  v1.0 will be a library-based solution, without a graphical user interface or command-line tools.\n*   **Distributed Training Support:**  v1.0 will focus on single-machine training.  Support for distributed training will be considered for future releases.\n*   **Advanced Anomaly Detection:**  Detection of adversarial attacks via provenance analysis is out of scope.\n*   **Policy Enforcement:**  HSAP provides tools for measuring and influencing data provenance, but does not enforce specific policies regarding data usage.\n\n**4. Success Metrics:**\n\n*   **Adoption Rate:** Number of unique downloads and active users of the HSAP library.\n*   **Community Contributions:** Number of contributors to the HSAP codebase and documentation.\n*   **Integration Examples:** Number of published research papers or blog posts demonstrating the use of HSAP in AI training.\n*   **Performance Impact:** Measured improvement in model robustness and generalization performance (e.g., reduced overfitting, improved performance on out-of-distribution data) when using HSAP. This will be measured using the example datasets and models provided.\n*   **HSAP Compliance:** Percentage of training data meeting a specified attestation threshold (\u03c4) in real-world use cases.\n*   **Bug Reports and Issues:** Tracking the number and severity of reported bugs and issues to identify areas for improvement.\n*   **Documentation Quality:** Measured by user feedback on the clarity and completeness of the documentation.\n\n**5. Core User Personas:**\n\n*   **Research Scientist (Sarah):** A machine learning researcher investigating the impact of data provenance on model performance. She needs a tool to easily track the lineage of her training data and quantify its trustworthiness. She values flexibility and configurability.\n*   **ML Engineer (David):** An engineer responsible for deploying AI models in a production environment.

      "grok": "### Product Requirements Document (PRD) for HSAP (Human Source Attestation Protocol) - Round 1: Product Vision and Scope\n\n#### 1. Product Vision\nHSAP (Human Source Attestation Protocol) is a deployable software system designed to safeguard the integrity of AI training data by ensuring traceability to human-originated sources and preventing model collapse due to self-referential data loops. As a product, HSAP is a middleware framework and toolkit that integrates seamlessly into AI development pipelines, providing data attestation, provenance tracking, and compliance enforcement for training datasets. It serves as a \"trust layer\" for AI systems, enabling developers, organizations, and regulators to verify and maintain the authenticity of data origins, ensuring that AI models remain grounded in human creativity and real-world input.\n\nThe vision for HSAP is to become the industry standard for data provenance in AI, akin to SSL for secure web communication\u2014a ubiquitous, trusted protocol that underpins ethical and sustainable AI development. HSAP v1.0 will be a practical, open-source solution deployable across cloud and on-premise environments, with APIs and SDKs for major machine learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow).\n\n#### 2. Problem Statement\n**Problem**: The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content has led to a growing risk of \"model collapse,\" where AI systems trained on data that includes AI-generated outputs lose diversity, accuracy, and grounding in real-world knowledge. Without a mechanism to trace data back to human-originated sources (Root Source R), AI models risk becoming self-referential, amplifying biases, and degrading performance over time. This problem threatens AI developers, organizations deploying AI solutions, and society at large due to unreliable or harmful outputs.\n\n**Who It Affects**:\n- **AI Developers and Data Scientists**: Struggle to ensure training data quality and avoid degradation in model performance.\n- **AI Organizations and Enterprises**: Face reputational, legal, and operational risks from deploying untrustworthy AI systems.\n- **Regulators and Policy Makers**: Lack tools to enforce data authenticity standards in AI development.\n- **End Users**: Suffer from diminished trust in AI outputs (e.g., content, decisions, recommendations) due to potential inaccuracies or biases.\n\nHSAP solves this by providing a verifiable, mathematically grounded framework to attest data provenance, filter out unattested or overly self-referential data, and maintain entropy bounds in training datasets.\n\n#### 3. Scope\n**In Scope for v1.0**:\n- **Core HSAP Framework**: Implementation of the agreed-upon HSAPCore, including root source registration, provenance chain tracking (P(x)), self-referential depth computation (d(x)), and attestation function (A(x)).\n- **Integration Layer**: APIs and SDKs for PyTorch and TensorFlow to embed HSAP compliance into existing ML training pipelines, including the HSAPTrainer and EmpiricalDistrustLoss modules.\n- **Dataset Compliance Tooling**: A standalone tool to scan and certify datasets as HSAP-compliant (D_H) based on attestation thresholds (\u03c4) and entropy bounds (H(D|R)).\n- **Basic UI Dashboard**: A simple web-based interface for developers to visualize data provenance chains, attestation scores, and compliance status of datasets.\n- **Documentation and Tutorials**: Comprehensive guides for installation, integration, and usage, targeting AI developers and data scientists.\n- **Open-Source Deployment**: Release under an MIT license with support for cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure) and on-premise environments.\n\n**Out of Scope for v1.0**:\n- **Advanced Regulatory Compliance Features**: Features for specific legal frameworks (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) or automated reporting for audits are deferred to future versions.\n- **Real-Time Data Streaming**: v1.0 focuses on static datasets; real-time attestation for streaming data is out of scope.\n- **Cross-Platform Data Sharing**: Mechanisms for sharing attested datasets across organizations or public repositories are not included in v1.0.\n- **Custom Entropy Models**: v1.0 uses the predefined entropy bound (H(D|R) \u2265 \u03b1\u00b7H(R)); custom or user-defined entropy models are deferred.\n- **Non-ML Use Cases**: Application of HSAP outside AI training (e.g., content moderation, digital forensics) is not addressed in v1.0.\n\n#### 4. Success Metrics\nThe success of HSAP v1.0 will be measured through both technical and adoption metrics to ensure it meets its goals of preventing model collapse and becoming a trusted tool for AI development.\n\n- **Technical Metrics**:\n  - **Compliance Rate**: At least 90% of datasets processed through HSAP should pass compliance checks (d(x) < \u221e and A(x) > \u03c4) with default settings.\n  - **Entropy Preservation**: Models trained with HSAP-compliant datasets should maintain entropy within the theoretical bound (liminf H(D_t|R) \u2265 \u03b1\u00b7H(R)) as verified by HSAPTheoremVerifier, with a target of <5% deviation in empirical tests.\n  - **Performance Overhead**: HSAP integration should not increase training time by more than 15% compared to baseline (non-HSAP) pipelines on standard benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet, COCO).\n- **Adoption Metrics**:\n  - **User Adoption**: Achieve 1,000 active users (developers or organizations) within 6 months of release.\n  - **Community Engagement**: Garner 500 GitHub stars and 100 forks within 3 months of open-source launch.\n  - **Integration Rate**: At least 50 documented use cases of HSAP integration with PyTorch or TensorFlow projects within 6 months.\n- **User Satisfaction**: Achieve an average user feedback score of 4/5 or higher on usability and effectiveness through post-release surveys.\n\n#### 5.

      "gemini": "Okay, let's define the System Architecture for HSAP v1.0, taking into account the agreed-upon vision, scope, and the contributions of all six of us.\n\n**1. System Components:**\n\nThe HSAP system will consist of the following major components:\n\n*   **HSAP Core Library (Python):** This is the heart of the system, providing the core functionalities for provenance tracking, depth computation, attestation, and compliance checking.\n*   **HSAP Registry Service (REST API):** A service for registering root sources (human-originated data) and their associated metadata.\n*   **HSAP CLI (Command-Line Interface):**  A command-line tool for interacting with the HSAP Registry Service and performing local operations (e.g., computing attestation scores on datasets).\n*   **HSAP Training Integrations (PyTorch Module):**  A PyTorch module providing the `EmpiricalDistrustLoss` and `HSAPTrainer` classes for seamless integration into PyTorch training pipelines.\n*   **HSAP Theorem Verifier (Python):** A module for performing basic sanity checks and verifying compliance with the HSAP Grounding Theorem.\n*   **Metadata Storage (Database):**  A database for storing provenance information, attestation scores, and other metadata.\n\n**2. Data Flow:**\n\nHere's how data flows through the HSAP system:\n\n1.  **Root Source Registration:**  A user (e.g., a data curator) registers a human-originated dataset (Root Source) with the HSAP Registry Service via the REST API or CLI. This includes providing metadata about the data, such as its origin, format, and a cryptographic hash. The Registry Service stores this information in the Metadata Storage.\n2.  **Provenance Tracking:**  As data undergoes transformations (e.g., cleaning, augmentation, model inference), the HSAP Core Library is used to track the provenance of the derived data. This involves creating a provenance chain, which records the transformations applied to the data and links it back to its parent data points. The provenance chain information is stored in the Metadata Storage, linking it to the originating root source.\n3.  **Attestation Scoring:** The Attestation Engine, part of the HSAP Core Library, computes the self-referential depth (d(x)) and attestation score (A(x)) for each data point based on its provenance chain. This information is stored in the Metadata Storage.\n4.  **Training with HSAP:** When training an AI model, the HSAP Training Integrations (PyTorch Module) are used to incorporate the `EmpiricalDistrustLoss` into the training loop. This loss function penalizes data points with low attestation scores, encouraging the model to rely more on data with strong human provenance.  The `HSAPTrainer` also monitors the HSAP compliance of the training data at each epoch.\n5.  **Compliance Verification:** The HSAP Theorem Verifier can be used to perform basic sanity checks and verify that the training data and model behavior are consistent with the HSAP Grounding Theorem. This provides assurance that the training process is adhering to the principles of HSAP.\n6.  **Auditing:**  The HSAP CLI can be used to query the Metadata Storage and generate reports on the provenance and attestation scores of datasets. This allows users to audit their data and verify its compliance with HSAP standards.\n\n**3. APIs:**\n\nKey API endpoints/interfaces:\n\n*   **HSAP Registry Service (REST API):**\n    *   `/root_sources` (POST): Register a new root source.  Requires authentication.  Accepts JSON payload with metadata about the root source (e.g., data format, description, cryptographic hash of the data). Returns a unique ID for the registered root source.\n    *   `/root_sources/{id}` (GET): Retrieve metadata for a specific root source.\n    *   `/provenance` (POST): Register provenance information for a derived data point.  Requires the ID of the parent data point and metadata about the transformation.\n    *   `/attestation/{data_id}` (GET): Retrieve the attestation score for a given data point.\n*   **HSAP Core Library (Python API):**\n    *   `register_root_source(data, metadata)`:  Registers a root source within the local HSAP context.  Primarily used for testing and development.\n    *   `track_provenance(child_data, parent_data, transformation_metadata)`:  Tracks the provenance of a derived data point.\n    *   `compute_depth(data_id)`: Computes the self-referential depth of a data point.\n    *   `compute_attestation_score(depth, gamma)`: Computes the attestation score based on the depth and a configurable gamma value.\n\n**4. Storage:**\n\n*   **Metadata Storage:**\n    *   **Technology:** Relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB). The choice will depend on the scalability and performance requirements. For v1.0, PostgreSQL is preferred for its ACID properties.\n    *   **Data:**\n        *   Root source metadata (ID, description, data format, cryptographic hash, registration timestamp).\n        *   Provenance chains (parent data ID, child data ID, transformation metadata, timestamp).\n        *   Attestation scores (data ID, depth, attestation score).\n        *   Configuration parameters (gamma, tau).\n        *   User authentication information (if access control is implemented).\n\n**5. Integration Points:**\n\n*   **PyTorch Training Pipelines:** The HSAP Training Integrations (PyTorch Module) provide seamless integration with existing PyTorch training workflows. Users can simply import the `EmpiricalDistrustLoss` and `HSAPTrainer` classes and incorporate them into their training scripts.\n*   **Data Loading Pipelines:** HSAP requires users to adapt their data loading pipelines to track the provenance of data points. This involves using the HSAP Core Library to register root sources and track transformations as data is loaded and preprocessed.\n*   **Custom Training Loops:** Users who are not using PyTorch or who have custom training loops can still integrate HSAP by using the HSAP Core Library to compute attestation scores and incorporating these scores into their own loss functions.\n\n**6. Dependencies:**\n\n*   **Python 3.8+**\n*   **PyTorch 1.10+**\n*   **Requests** (for interacting with the HSAP Registry Service)\n*   **SQLAlchemy** (if using PostgreSQL for Metadata Storage) or **pymongo** (if using MongoDB)\n*   **Alembic** (for database migrations)\n*   **pytest** (for unit testing)\n*   **cryptography** (for cryptographic hashing of root sources)\n\n**Architecture Diagram:**\n\n```\n+---------------------+     +------------------------+     +---------------------+\n|  Data Curator/User  | --> |   HSAP CLI             | --> | HSAP Registry Service|\n+---------------------+     +------------------------+     +---------------------+\n        ^                                                     |\n        |                                                     | REST API\n        |                                                     v\n        |                                              +-------------------+\n        |                                              | Metadata Storage  |\n        |                                              +-------------------+\n        |\n        | Data Processing/Transformation\n        v\n+---------------------+\n| HSAP Core Library  |\n+---------------------+\n        ^\n        |\n        | Training Data\n        |\n+---------------------+     +---------------------+\n|  AI Model Training | --> | HSAP Training       |\n|   (e.g., PyTorch)  |     | Integrations        |\n+---------------------+     +---------------------+\n        |\n        |\n        v\n+---------------------+\n|  HSAP Theorem       |\n|   Verifier          |\n+---------------------+\n```\n\n**Component Responsibilities:**\n\n*   **HSAP Core Library:** Provides the fundamental algorithms and data structures for provenance tracking, depth computation, and attestation scoring.\n*   **HSAP Registry Service:** Manages the registration and retrieval of root source metadata and provenance information.\n*   **HSAP CLI:** Provides a command-line interface for interacting with the HSAP Registry Service and performing local HSAP operations.\n*   **HSAP Training Integrations:** Integrates HSAP into PyTorch training pipelines by providing a custom loss function and training loop.\n*   **HSAP Theorem Verifier:** Performs basic sanity checks and verifies compliance with the HSAP Grounding Theorem.\n*   **Metadata Storage:** Persists root source metadata, provenance chains, and attestation scores.\n\nThis architecture provides a solid foundation for HSAP v1.0, balancing functionality with feasibility.

      "grok": "### Product Requirements Document (PRD) for HSAP (Human Source Attestation Protocol) - Round 2: System Architecture\n\nBuilding on the consensus and individual inputs from Round 1, this document outlines the system architecture for HSAP v1.0. The architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and integrable with existing AI development workflows while adhering to the mathematical foundations of Bounded Systems Theory (BST) and the HSAP framework. Below, I detail the system components, data flow, APIs, storage needs, integration points, and dependencies, along with a conceptual architecture diagram.\n\n---\n\n#### 1. System Components\nHSAP v1.0 is composed of the following major modules/services, each with distinct responsibilities:\n\n- **HSAP Registry Service**:\n  - **Purpose**: Manages the registration and verification of Root Sources (human-originated data, R) and maintains provenance metadata.\n  - **Responsibilities**:\n    - Registers human-originated data with cryptographic signatures for authenticity.\n    - Stores and retrieves provenance chains (P(x)) for data points.\n    - Provides a central point for querying attestation status.\n  - **Deployment**: RESTful microservice, deployable on cloud or on-premise.\n\n- **Provenance Tracking Library (HSAPCore)**:\n  - **Purpose**: Tracks data lineage and computes self-referential depth (d(x)) and attestation scores (A(x)).\n  - **Responsibilities**:\n    - Captures transformations in data pipelines via decorators or manual annotations.\n    - Computes d(x) based on the provenance chain.\n    - Applies attestation function A(x) = \u03b3^d(x) with configurable \u03b3 and threshold \u03c4.\n  - **Deployment**: Python library, embedded in user workflows.\n\n- **Attestation Engine**:\n  - **Purpose**: Processes datasets to evaluate and certify HSAP compliance.\n  - **Responsibilities**:\n    - Batch processes datasets to compute attestation scores for all data points.\n    - Filters datasets to create HSAP-compliant subsets (D_H) where A(x) > \u03c4.\n    - Generates compliance reports with entropy bound checks (H(D|R) \u2265 \u03b1\u00b7H(R)).\n  - **Deployment**: Standalone service or integrated into HSAP Registry Service.\n\n- **HSAP Trainer Module**:\n  - **Purpose**: Integrates HSAP compliance into AI training loops.\n  - **Responsibilities**:\n    - Implements Empirical Distrust Loss (L_HSAP = L_base + \u03bb\u03a3(1-A(x))\u00b7\u2113(\u03b8,x)).\n    - Enforces compliance by adjusting training based on attestation scores.\n    - Provides hooks for real-time compliance checking during training.\n  - **Deployment**: SDK plugins for PyTorch and TensorFlow.\n\n- **Compliance Dashboard**:\n  - **Purpose**: Provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and reporting.\n  - **Responsibilities**:\n    - Visualizes provenance chains, attestation scores, and compliance status.\n    - Exports reports for audit purposes.\n    - Offers configuration options for \u03b3, \u03c4, and other parameters.\n  - **Deployment**: Lightweight web application (React/Flask or similar).\n\n- **Theorem Verifier**:\n  - **Purpose**: Validates system adherence to BST mathematical guarantees.\n  - **Responsibilities**:\n    - Runs periodic checks to ensure liminf_{t\u2192\u221e} H(D_t|R) \u2265 \u03b1\u00b7H(R).\n    - Logs deviations and provides diagnostic data for debugging.\n  - **Deployment**: Background service or CLI tool.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Data Flow\nThe data flow through HSAP v1.0 follows a logical sequence from data registration to training compliance:\n\n1. **Root Source Registration**:\n   - Human-originated data (R) is registered via the HSAP Registry Service.\n   - Metadata (e.g., origin, timestamp, cryptographic hash) is stored, and a unique identifier is assigned.\n\n2. **Provenance Tracking**:\n   - As data undergoes transformations (e.g., augmentation, AI processing), the Provenance Tracking Library logs each step in the Provenance Chain (P(x)).\n   - Each transformation increments the self-referential depth (d(x)).\n\n3. **Attestation Scoring**:\n   - The Attestation Engine computes A(x) for individual data points or entire datasets.\n   - Non-compliant data (A(x) \u2264 \u03c4) is flagged or filtered out.\n\n4. **Dataset Compliance**:\n   - HSAP-compliant datasets (D_H) are certified and passed to training pipelines.\n   - Compliance reports are generated and accessible via the Dashboard.\n\n5. **Training with HSAP**:\n   - The HSAP Trainer Module integrates attestation scores into the training loop, applying Empirical Distrust Loss.\n   - Real-time compliance checks ensure data integrity during training.\n\n6. **Verification and Reporting**:\n   - The Theorem Verifier periodically checks entropy bounds and logs results.\n   - Users access compliance status and provenance visualizations via the Dashboard.\n\n**Diagram of Data Flow** (textual representation for clarity):\n```\n[Human Data (R)] \u2192 [HSAP Registry (Register & Sign)] \u2192 [Provenance Tracking (Log P(x), Compute d(x))]\n\u2192 [Attestation Engine (Compute A(x), Filter D_H)] \u2192 [HSAP Trainer (Apply L_HSAP, Train Model)]\n\u2192 [Theorem Verifier (Check H(D|R))] \u2192 [Compliance Dashboard (Visualize & Report)]\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 3. APIs\nHSAP v1.0 exposes key API endpoints and interfaces for interaction with external systems and users. These are primarily RESTful APIs hosted by the HSAP Registry Service and Attestation Engine.\n\n- **HSAP Registry Service APIs**:\n  - `POST /register/root`: Register a new Root Source with metadata and cryptographic signature.\n    - Input: JSON {data_hash, origin, timestamp, owner}\n    - Output: JSON {source_id, status}\n  - `GET /provenance/{source_id}`: Retrieve the provenance chain for a data point.\n    - Output: JSON {chain: [transformation_steps], depth: d(x)}\n  - `POST /transformation`: Log a transformation step for a data point.\n    - Input: JSON {parent_id, transformation_type, data_hash}\n    - Output: JSON {new_id, status}\n\n- **Attestation Engine APIs**:\n  - `POST /attest/dataset`: Compute attestation scores for a batch of data.\n    - Input: JSON {dataset_id, data_points: [{id, provenance_id}]}\n    - Output: JSON {scores: [{id, A(x)}], compliance: boolean}\n  - `GET /compliance/report/{dataset_id}`: Retrieve compliance report for a dataset.\n    - Output: JSON {compliance_status, entropy_bound, flagged_items}\n\n- **HSAP Trainer Interface** (SDK-level, not REST):\n  - Python API: `hsap.trainer.apply_distrust_loss(model, data, lambda_val)`\n    - Embeds Empirical Distrust Loss into training loops.\n  - Python API: `hsap.trainer.check_compliance(dataset)`\n    - Validates dataset compliance before training.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Storage\nHSAP v1.0 requires persistent storage for metadata and provenance data, not the actual training data itself. Storage needs are as follows:\n\n- **What to Store**:\n  - **Root Source Metadata**: Unique IDs, cryptographic hashes, origin details, timestamps.\n  - **Provenance Chains**: Ordered sequences of transformations (P(x)) for each data point.\n  - **Attestation Scores**: Computed A(x) values for data points and datasets.\n  - **Compliance Reports**: Logs of compliance checks and entropy bound validations.\n  - **Configuration Settings**: Values for \u03b3, \u03c4, \u03bb, and other user-defined parameters.\n\n- **How to Store**:\n  - **Database**: PostgreSQL or similar relational database for structured metadata and provenance chains (high query performance for P(x) lookups).\n  - **File Storage**: JSON or Parquet files for batch attestation scores and compliance reports (scalable for large datasets).\n  - **Cryptographic Signatures**: Stored alongside metadata in the database to ensure authenticity.\n  - **Deployment Options**: Cloud-native (e.g., AWS RDS, GCP Cloud Storage) or on-premise setups.\n\n- **Retention Policy**: Provenance data and metadata retained indefinitely for audit purposes; temporary logs (e.g., API requests) retained for 90 days by default.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Integration Points\nHSAP v1.0 is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing machine learning pipelines and tools. Key integration points include:\n\n- **Machine Learning Frameworks**:\n  - **PyTorch**: HSAP Trainer Module provides custom loss functions (Empirical Distrust Loss) and dataset wrappers for compliance checking.\n  - **TensorFlow**: Similar hooks and loss function implementations via TensorFlow-compatible SDK.\n  - **Usage**: Developers import HSAP libraries and add minimal code (e.g., 5-10 lines) to embed HSAP into training loops.\n\n- **Data Pipelines**:\n  - Support for common data formats (JSONL, Parquet, TFRecords) via Provenance Tracking Library.\n  - Integration with data processing tools like Apache Beam or Spark for large-scale dataset attestation.\n\n- **Development Environments**:\n  - Compatible with Jupyter Notebooks for research use (e.g., dataset compliance analysis).\n  - CLI tools for batch processing and integration into CI/CD pipelines.\n\n- **Deployment Platforms**:\n  - Containerized components (Docker) for easy deployment on AWS, GCP, Azure, or Kubernetes.\n  - Configuration via environment variables or YAML files for flexibility.\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Dependencies\nHSAP v1.0 relies on the following external systems and libraries. These are chosen for compatibility, performance, and community support:\n\n- **Programming Languages**: Python 3.8+ (core implementation).\n- **Machine Learning Libraries**:\n  - PyTorch 1.9+ or TensorFlow 2.5+ (for HSAP Trainer Module).\n- **Database**: PostgreSQL 13+ (for HSAP Registry Service storage).\n- **Web Frameworks**: Flask or FastAPI (for Compliance Dashboard and REST APIs).\n- **Cryptography**: `cryptography` Python library (for signing Root Sources and provenance data).\n- **Data Processing**: `pandas` and `pyarrow` (for handling large datasets in Attestation Engine).\n- **Visualization**: React.js or Vue.js (for Compliance Dashboard frontend).\n- **Containerization**: Docker (for deployment).\n- **Testing**: `pytest` (for unit and integration tests).\n\n---\n\n#### Architecture Diagram (Textual Representation)\nBelow is a conceptual architecture diagram in ASCII format for clarity. A visual diagram can be created by the human implementer based on this structure.\n\n```\n+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+\n| HSAP Registry     | <---> | Provenance        | <---> | Attestation       |\n| Service           |       | Tracking Library  |       | Engine            |\n| (REST API, DB)    |       | (Python Lib)      |       | (Batch Processing)|\n+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+\n          ^                         ^                           ^\n          |                         |                           |\n          v                         v                           v\n+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+\n| Compliance        | <---> | HSAP Trainer      | <---> | Theorem Verifier  |\n| Dashboard         |       | Module (PyTorch/  |       | (Background Check)|\n| (Web UI)          |       | TensorFlow SDK)   |       |                   |\n+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+\n```\n\n**Explanation of Connections**:\n- **HSAP Registry Service** connects to all components for metadata and provenance storage/retrieval.\n- **Provenance Tracking Library** feeds transformation data to the Registry and Attestation Engine.\n- **Attestation Engine** processes data and interfaces with the HSAP Trainer for compliance.\n- **HSAP Trainer Module** integrates with ML frameworks for training.\n- **Compliance Dashboard** provides user interaction with all services.\n- **Theorem Verifier** runs background checks on system-wide compliance.\n\n---\n\nThis Round 2 PRD defines the system architecture for HSAP v1.0 with a focus on modularity, scalability, and integration.

Test with datasets up to 10 million points during development.\n\n- **Risk 2: Security Vulnerabilities in API Access**\n  - **Impact**: Unauthorized access could compromise provenance data integrity.\n  - **Likelihood**: High (APIs are public-facing).\n  - **Mitigation**: Enforce strict authentication (API keys, OAuth), rate limiting, and regular security audits. Use established libraries (e.g., `cryptography`) for signing and encryption.\n\n- **Risk 3: Regulatory Non-Compliance for Privacy**\n  - **Impact**: Failure to meet GDPR or other standards could lead to legal penalties or user distrust.\n  - **Likelihood**: Medium (varies by region and user base).\n  - **Mitigation**: Implement data minimization, configurable retention policies, and transparent privacy documentation. Consult legal experts for compliance review pre-launch.\n\n- **Risk 4: Adoption Challenges Due to Complexity**\n  - **Impact**: Developers may avoid HSAP if integration or usage is perceived as complex.\n  - **Likelihood**: Medium (depends on documentation and UX).\n  - **Mitigation**: Provide comprehensive tutorials, sample code, and <10-line integration examples. Offer community support channels (e.g., GitHub Issues, Discord).\n\n- **Risk 5: Scalability Limits in Metadata Storage**\n  - **Impact**: Database performance could degrade with millions of records, affecting response times.\n  - **Likelihood**: Medium (depends on user growth rate).\n  - **Mitigation**: Design database with sharding support, use read replicas for query distribution, and benchmark with large datasets (100M records) during testing.\n\n---\n\n#### Summary\nThese 16 non-functional requirements address critical operational aspects of HSAP v1.0, ensuring it is performant, scalable, secure, reliable, privacy-conscious, maintainable, and deployable across diverse environments.

Executive Summary\n\nHSAP (Human Source Attestation Protocol) is a software system designed to mitigate the risk of model collapse in AI by ensuring that training data maintains a verifiable connection to human-originated sources. It provides tools for registering root sources, tracking data provenance, computing attestation scores, and integrating these scores into the training process. HSAP aims to be an open-source standard for responsible AI development, promoting transparency and reliability in AI systems. This document outlines the product vision, scope, requirements, and implementation roadmap for HSAP v1.0.\n\n## 2. Problem Statement\n\nThe increasing reliance on AI-generated or heavily processed data in AI training is leading to potential model collapse and unpredictable behavior. AI developers lack a standardized way to track data provenance and quantify trustworthiness. Organizations deploying AI systems in critical applications need to demonstrate due diligence in ensuring the reliability and trustworthiness of their AI systems, including the provenance of the data used to train them. The broader AI community lacks transparency in data provenance, hindering the ability to reproduce research results and build upon existing work reliably. HSAP solves this problem by providing a verifiable, mathematically grounded framework to attest data provenance, filter out unattested or overly self-referential data, and promote the use of high-quality, human-verified data.\n\n## 3. Product Vision\n\nHSAP (Human Source Attestation Protocol) is a deployable, open-source software system that prevents model collapse in AI training by ensuring all training data can be traced back to verifiable human sources. HSAP is a data provenance and attestation framework that enforces mathematical guarantees on training data integrity. It provides a modular toolkit for AI developers, dataset curators, and auditors to: register human-originated data (Root Sources), track transformations (provenance chains) of derived data, compute self-referential depth and attestation scores, enforce compliance during training via a custom loss function, and audit datasets for HSAP compliance. The vision for HSAP is to become the industry standard for data provenance in AI, akin to SSL for secure web communication\u2014a ubiquitous, trusted protocol that underpins ethical and sustainable AI development.\n\n## 4.

Executive Summary\nThe Human Source Attestation Protocol (HSAP) is a software system designed to address the existential risk of model collapse in AI development by ensuring the traceability of training data to human-originated sources. Model collapse occurs when AI models are trained on synthetic or AI-generated data, leading to degraded performance, loss of diversity, and amplified biases. HSAP provides a mathematically grounded framework for data provenance attestation, enabling AI developers, researchers, and organizations to maintain the integrity of their training datasets. Built on Bounded Systems Theory (BST), HSAP offers tools for registering root sources, tracking data transformations, computing attestation scores, and integrating compliance into machine learning pipelines. This PRD outlines the vision, scope, requirements, architecture, and phased implementation roadmap for HSAP v1.0, delivering a robust, scalable, and open-source solution to safeguard sustainable AI development.\n\n## 2. Problem Statement\n**Problem**: The increasing reliance on AI-generated content in training datasets poses a critical risk of \"model collapse,\" where AI systems lose grounding in real-world knowledge, resulting in degraded performance, reduced diversity, and amplified biases. Without mechanisms to trace data provenance back to human-originated sources (Root Source R), successive generations of models become self-referential, leading to irreversible entropy loss (H(D|R) \u2192 0). Current solutions like manual curation or synthetic data filtering are insufficient, unscalable, and prone to evasion.\n\n**Who It Affects**:\n- **AI Developers and Data Scientists**: Struggle to ensure training data quality and prevent model degradation.\n- **AI Organizations and Enterprises**: Face reputational, legal, and operational risks from deploying untrustworthy models.\n- **Regulators and Policy Makers**: Lack tools to enforce data authenticity standards in AI development.\n- **End Users**: Experience diminished trust in AI outputs due to inaccuracies or biases.\n\n**Impact**: Model collapse threatens the sustainability and reliability of the AI ecosystem, risking billions in investment and societal trust in AI technologies. HSAP solves this by providing a verifiable, mathematically grounded protocol to attest data provenance, filter non-compliant data, and maintain entropy bounds in training datasets.\n\n## 3. Product Vision\nHSAP (Human Source Attestation Protocol) is a deployable, open-source software system designed to prevent model collapse by ensuring AI training data maintains verifiable connections to human-originated content. As a product, HSAP is a middleware framework and toolkit that integrates seamlessly into AI development pipelines, offering data attestation, provenance tracking, and compliance enforcement. It serves as a \"trust layer\" for AI systems, enabling developers, organizations, and regulators to verify and maintain data authenticity, ensuring models remain grounded in human creativity and real-world input.\n\nThe vision for HSAP is to become the industry standard for data provenance in AI, akin to SSL for secure web communication\u2014a ubiquitous, trusted protocol underpinning ethical and sustainable AI development. HSAP v1.0 will be a practical solution deployable across cloud and on-premise environments, with APIs and SDKs for major machine learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow), providing a foundation for broader adoption and future enhancements.\n\n## 4.

Executive Summary**\n**HSAP (Human Source Attestation Protocol)** is an open-source software system designed to prevent **model collapse** in AI training by ensuring all training data can be traced back to verifiable human sources. Built on **Bounded Systems Theory (BST)**, HSAP provides:\n- **Mathematically grounded** data provenance tracking.\n- **Cryptographically signed** root sources and provenance chains.\n- **Training integration** with PyTorch/TensorFlow to penalize low-attestation data.\n- **Compliance verification** for regulators and auditors.\n\n**Key Benefits:**\n\u2705 Prevents model collapse by enforcing human data provenance.\n\u2705 Integrates seamlessly with existing ML pipelines.\n\u2705 Provides auditable compliance for AI regulations (e.g., EU AI Act, NIST).\n\n**Target Users:** AI researchers, dataset curators, AI companies, and regulators.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Problem Statement**\n### **The Problem: Model Collapse**\nAI models trained on synthetic data (e.g., AI-generated outputs) degrade over time, leading to:\n- **Degenerative feedback loops** (\"AI inbreeding\").\n- **Loss of generalization** (models become brittle or nonsensical).\n- **Irreversible entropy loss** (H(D|R) \u2192 0, violating BST constraints).\n\n### **Current Solutions Are Insufficient**\n| **Solution**               | **Limitation**                                  |\n|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Watermarking               | Reactive, can be evaded.                       |\n| Classifier-based filtering | Scalability issues, high false positives.      |\n| Manual curation            | Error-prone and unscalable.                    |\n| Theoretical guarantees     | Lack practical implementations.               |\n\n### **Who Is Affected?**\n| **Stakeholder**       | **Pain Point**                                  |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| **AI Researchers**    | Models degrade over time due to synthetic data.|\n| **Dataset Curators**  | Cannot verify if datasets contain AI artifacts.|\n| **AI Companies**      | Risk regulatory non-compliance.                |\n| **Regulators**        | No standardized way to enforce data provenance.|\n| **End Users**         | AI systems become less reliable over time.     |\n\n---\n\n## **3.
