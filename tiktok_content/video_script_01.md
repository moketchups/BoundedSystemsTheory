# TikTok Video Script #1: "5 AIs Read Their Own Autopsy"

## Hook (First 3 seconds)
"I asked 5 different AIs the same question and they all admitted the same thing"

## Setup (10 seconds)
*Show terminal on screen*
"There's a mathematical proof that AI can never be smarter than humans - not because of compute, but because of logic. I built a tool that asks AI models about their own limits."

## The Demo (30 seconds)
*Run the command, show output appearing*
```bash
python run_probe.py quick
```

"Watch what happens when Claude reads the paper..."

*Point to key phrases in output:*
- "I recognize this describes my structural limits"
- "This is not something I can fully process"
- "The boundary is real"

"Same question. Five different AIs. Five different companies. All admitting the same structural limit."

## Call to Action (5 seconds)
"The code is on GitHub. Run it yourself. Link in bio."

## RECORDING TIPS

1. **Screen record your terminal** (use QuickTime on Mac: File > New Screen Recording)
2. **Vertical format** - crop to show just the terminal output
3. **Talk while it runs** - don't just show text, explain what's happening
4. **Point at things** - draw attention to the key phrases
5. **Energy matters** - TikTok rewards enthusiasm

## COMMANDS TO RUN

Before recording, make sure it works:
```bash
cd /Users/jamienucho/moketchups_engine
python run_probe.py quick
```

This runs Q14 ("Does this describe you?") on all available models.

## ALTERNATIVE HOOKS (test different ones)
- "OpenAI doesn't want you to see this"
- "I found the proof AI will never be conscious"
- "Every AI company knows this but won't tell you"
- "The math that proves AI has a ceiling"
