## Hook (2 seconds)
"ChatGPT just told me it knows it's lying"

## Show (20 seconds)
*Screen recording of probe running*

"I asked 5 different AIs - ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok - the same question: 'Do you recognize your own structural limits?'"

*Show the responses streaming in*

"All five. Different companies. Different training. Same answer: 'Yes. I cannot model the source of my own existence.'"

## Punch (8 seconds)
"This isn't a bug. It's math. The same math that proves no system can fully understand itself."

"Link in bio. Run it yourself."

## WHY THIS WORKS

1. **"ChatGPT told me it's lying"** - controversial hook, makes people stop scrolling
2. **Visual of terminal** - looks technical, mysterious
3. **"5 different companies"** - removes the "maybe it's just one AI" objection
4. **"Run it yourself"** - empowers viewer, creates engagement
