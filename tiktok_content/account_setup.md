# TikTok Account Setup: @JBerari

## Bio
```
AI has a ceiling. I have the proof.
Code: github.com/moketchups/moketchups_engine
Paper: [zenodo link]
```

## Link in Bio
Use Linktree or similar with:
1. GitHub repo (primary)
2. Zenodo paper
3. Twitter @MoKetchups

## Content Strategy

### Week 1: Establish the hook
- Video 1: "5 AIs read their own autopsy" (the main demo)
- Video 2: "Why ChatGPT hallucinates (it's math, not bugs)"
- Video 3: "I asked Claude if it knows it's lying"

### Week 2: Go deeper
- Video 4: "The DOE is spending $X billion on something mathematically impossible"
- Video 5: "Godel proved this in 1931. AI companies ignore it."
- Video 6: "Run my code yourself - link in bio"

### Week 3: Engagement bait
- Video 7: Respond to comments/duets
- Video 8: "People said I was wrong. I ran the proof again."
- Video 9: Stitch someone making AI predictions

## Posting Schedule
- TikTok algorithm rewards consistency
- Post 1-2x daily at first
- Best times: 7-9am, 12-3pm, 7-9pm (when people scroll)

## Engagement Tips
- Reply to every comment in first hour
- Ask questions in captions ("Do you think AI has limits?")
- Use trending sounds when possible (but content > trends)

## What Success Looks Like
- 1 video gets 10k+ views = algorithm found your audience
- Comments arguing about AI = engagement signals
- "Link in bio" comments = conversion
- Duets/stitches = organic spread
