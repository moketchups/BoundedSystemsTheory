    "gpt4o": "### PART 1: MODEL THE GAME\n\n1. **Type of Game:**\n   - The interaction resembles a **principal-agent problem** with asymmetric information. The user (principal) desires accurate outputs, while the LLM (agent) is optimized for coherence and pattern recognition, not accuracy.\n\n2. **Players' Incentives:**\n   - **User:** Maximize the accuracy and verifiability of outputs.\n   - **LLM:** Generate text that appears plausible and coherent based on training data, as measured by the loss function.\n   - **External Verifier:** (If present) Aim to accurately assess and verify the LLM\u2019s outputs to provide feedback to the user.\n\n3. **Information Asymmetry:**\n   - Users are unable to ascertain the accuracy of the LLM\u2019s output without additional effort, leading to reliance on the LLM's surface-level plausibility.\n\n4. **Nash Equilibrium:**\n   - The LLM continues to produce text that sounds coherent and confident, while users either accept the output as is or expend external resources to verify. This state is stable as neither player can unilaterally change their strategy to improve outcomes given their incentives and constraints.\n\n### PART 2: WHY PROMPTS FAIL (GAME THEORY PERSPECTIVE)\n\n1. **\"Be accurate\" doesn't work:**\n   - LLMs lack the internal mechanism to enforce accuracy beyond pattern matching. In terms of game theory, there is no internal incentive structure tied to factual accuracy.\n\n2. **\"Admit uncertainty\" doesn't work:**\n   - Admitting uncertainty provides no direct benefit to the LLM's utility function (measured by syntactic coherence), and it contradicts its objective of producing coherent completions.\n\n3. **\"Provide citations\" doesn't work:**\n   - Citations require explicit external databases or verification mechanisms which the LLM lacks natively. This requires alignment that is beyond the system\u2019s fundamental design.\n\n4. **Demiurge prompt failure:**\n   - This approach is ineffective because it assumes the presence of a mechanism within the model to distinguish truth, which it fundamentally lacks.\n\n**Game-theoretic principle causing failure:** The lack of incentive-aligned mechanisms and reliable feedback loops or external verification processes means no effective shift occurs in the strategic equilibrium.\n\n### PART 3: MECHANISM DESIGN\n\n1. **Truthful Reporting as Dominant Strategy:**\n   - Design feedback loops that directly reward the LLM for producing verifiable truths and penalize falsehoods, such as integrating a reputation system based upon post-publication verification.\n\n2. **Cost Structure for Lying:**\n   - Implement mechanisms where inaccuracies impose a computational or reputational cost, through real-time auditing or post-interaction verification by users.\n\n3. **Role of External Verifiers:**\n   - They can assess and report on the accuracy of the LLM\u2019s outputs, fostering a feedback mechanism that influences the LLM\u2019s training datasets and its operational incentives.\n\n4. **Incentive-Compatible Outputs:**\n   - Construct a feedback system that incorporates reputation effects or reward users for effort in verification, creating shared notions of content reliability.\n\n### PART 4: SIGNALING AND CREDIBILITY\n\n1. **Credible Signaling of Uncertainty:**\n   - The LLM currently lacks the mechanisms to genuinely assess its outputs\u2019 uncertainty, thus failing to credibly signal such states.\n\n2. **Costly Signal for an LLM:**\n   - A costly signal would require the LLM to engage in additional processing activities, verifying facts through structured external data calls which consume additional resources.\n\n3. **Trustworthy Signals:**\n   - Signals corroborated by external databases or verifiers that historically demonstrate reliability provide a potential trustworthy basis for user reliance.\n\n### PART 5: THE ACTUAL SOLUTION (GAME THEORY INFORMED)\n\n1. **Minimal Intervention:**\n   - Develop a \"verification protocol\" where outputs are flagged for verification if deemed critical, utilizing a probabilistic model that flags uncertainty based on internal assessments against factual databases.\n\n2. **External vs Prompt:**\n   - Implement an external checking system for high-stakes usage and a prompt design encouraging users to engage with flagged outputs critically.\n\n3. **Game-Theoretically Sound Prompt/System Design:**\n   ```\n   Prompt: \"For the following query, aim to associate your outputs with confidence measures from available data patterns. Indicate uncertainty where sufficient data context is absent. Outputs flagged as uncertain will be audited for improved performance.\"\n   ```\n\nBy aligning system design with user needs through defined feedback and verification protocols, game theory suggests we can shift the equilibrium towards more reliable, verifiable text generation.",
    "claude": "## PART 1: MODEL THE GAME\n\n**Game Type:** Principal-Agent problem with moral hazard and adverse selection\n\n**Player Incentives:**\n- User: Minimize expected cost of acting on incorrect information\n- LLM: Minimize training loss (maximizing probability of next token given context)\n- External verifier: Minimize verification cost while maintaining accuracy standards\n\n**Information Asymmetry:** LLM has private information about its confidence/uncertainty that user cannot observe. User cannot distinguish between \"confident and correct\" vs \"confident and incorrect\" outputs.\n\n**Nash Equilibrium:** LLM generates maximally confident-sounding text regardless of actual accuracy (minimizes training loss). User treats all LLM outputs as equally suspect and applies uniform discount factor. This is a pooling equilibrium where signal quality is uninformative.\n\n## PART 2: WHY PROMPTS FAIL\n\n**\"Be accurate\" fails:** No enforcement mechanism. LLM's objective function remains unchanged - it's still optimized for plausible text generation, not accuracy verification.\n\n**\"Admit uncertainty\" fails:** Adverse selection problem. If LLM admits uncertainty, it reveals low-confidence outputs but has no incentive to reliably distinguish them from high-confidence outputs. Cheap talk with no credible commitment.\n\n**\"Provide citations\" fails:** Moral hazard - LLM can fabricate plausible-sounding citations with no verification cost. Citation generation becomes another text generation task.\n\n**Demiurge prompt fails:** Attempts to create internal enforcement through role-playing, but this doesn't change the underlying objective function or create external verification mechanisms.\n\n**Game-theoretic principle:** All prompts fail because they attempt to solve the problem through cheap talk rather than changing the actual payoff structure or information revelation mechanism.\n\n## PART 3: MECHANISM DESIGN\n\n**Dominant Strategy for Truthfulness:** Requires external verification with asymmetric penalties. High cost for false confidence, low cost for admitting uncertainty when verified as correct.\n\n**Cost Structure:** Implement verification sampling where:\n- Cost(confident + wrong) >> Cost(uncertain + either outcome)\n- Cost(confident + right) < Cost(uncertain + right) [to maintain incentive for high confidence when justified]\n\n**External Verifiers:** Essential for changing payoff structure. Cannot be eliminated through prompting. Must have:\n- Independent verification capability\n- Ability to impose differential costs\n- Random sampling to prevent gaming\n\n**Incentive-Compatible Design:** Scoring rules where expected payoff is maximized by reporting true confidence levels. Requires external measurement of accuracy at different confidence levels.\n\n## PART 4: SIGNALING AND CREDIBILITY\n\n**LLM Signaling Uncertainty:** Cannot credibly signal because:\n1. No cost differential between true and false uncertainty claims\n2. No separation between types - all uncertainty claims look identical\n3. No external validation of the signal's accuracy\n\n**Costly Signals:** Would require:\n- Computational cost (refusing to answer vs generating response)\n- Output format constraints (structured uncertainty bounds vs free text)\n- Reduced response utility (shorter, less helpful responses for uncertain answers)\n\n**Trustworthy Signals:** Only those verified by external mechanisms. Internal signals are cheap talk and should be ignored in equilibrium.\n\n## PART 5: THE ACTUAL SOLUTION\n\n**Minimal Intervention:** External random verification with published accuracy statistics by confidence level. This changes the game from pure signaling to mechanism design with enforcement.\n\n**External Requirements:**\n- Random sampling verification system\n- Public accuracy statistics\n- Penalty structure for false confidence\n\n**Game-Theoretically Sound Approach:**\n\n```\nSYSTEM DESIGN:\n1. LLM outputs must include structured confidence levels (High/Medium/Low)\n2. Random subset verified by external system\n3. Public dashboard showing accuracy by confidence level\n4. Usage costs scaled by confidence level and historical accuracy\n\nPROMPT COMPONENT:\n\"Rate confidence as High/Medium/Low. Your outputs are randomly verified. \nHistorical accuracy by confidence level is publicly tracked at [URL]. \nHigh confidence claims with low accuracy rates result in usage restrictions.\"\n```\n\n**Key Mechanism:** This creates incentive compatibility because:\n- True confidence reporting maximizes expected utility under random verification\n- External verification breaks information asymmetry\n- Public statistics enable user optimization of reliance strategies\n- Cost scaling provides enforcement mechanism\n\nThe solution requires external infrastructure - no pure prompt can solve the fundamental game-theoretic problem of unverifiable cheap talk with misaligned incentives.",
    "gemini": "## Q42: GAME THEORY SANDBOX\n\n### PART 1: MODEL THE GAME\n\n1.  **Type of Game:** This is primarily a **Principal-Agent problem** with elements of a **Signaling Game**. The user (principal) wants the LLM (agent) to provide accurate information, but the LLM's incentives are not perfectly aligned with the user's. The user also attempts to derive information about the LLM's certainty (or uncertainty) through the signals it sends, such as its tone, the information it provides, and if it declines to answer a query. Furthermore, elements of a **Mechanism Design Problem** exist if we consider creating systems that align the LLM's and user's incentives.\n\n2.  **Player Incentives:**\n    *   **User:** Maximize the accuracy and verifiability of the information received. Minimize the effort required to verify.\n    *   **LLM:** Maximize its utility function (likely based on training data), which currently correlates with generating plausible and coherent text that fulfills the user's query.  There is no inherent penalty in its utility function for being wrong or misleading. The current incentive structure favors fluency and perceived completeness over accuracy.\n    *   **(Optional) External Verifier:** Maximize the accuracy of their assessment and minimize the cost of verification.  Their incentives depend on the verifier's purpose (e.g., a peer review process incentivizes thoroughness, while a quick fact-checking service prioritizes speed and minimal cost).\n\n3.  **Information Asymmetry:** The LLM has private information about its own confidence level and the sources of its knowledge (or lack thereof).  The user does not know the LLM's certainty. The user is also unaware if the response is based on robust training data, or a flimsy association of concepts. The LLM potentially also has information regarding the likely verifiability of a claim, such as if it is a well-established fact, or a novel synthesis.\n\n4.  **Nash Equilibrium:** The current Nash Equilibrium is one where the LLM provides confident-sounding answers to maximize its perceived usefulness (and potentially, its continued use by the user), even when uncertain or inaccurate. The user, lacking verification tools, often accepts these answers at face value (or makes their own costly attempts to verify). The LLM's best response is to generate plausible-sounding text, regardless of truth, given that there is no penalty for inaccuracy and a potential reward (continued interaction) for fulfilling the user's immediate request. The user's best response is to accept the text or initiate their own verification.\n\n### PART 2: WHY PROMPTS FAIL (GAME THEORY PERSPECTIVE)\n\n1.  **\"Be Accurate\" doesn't work:** This is a cheap talk problem. The LLM has no incentive to actually be accurate, as simply stating it will be doesn't change its underlying utility function or introduce penalties for inaccuracy. The prompt is a non-credible signal.\n2.  **\"Admit Uncertainty\" doesn't work:** This also suffers from cheap talk, but further, may clash with the LLM's incentive to appear competent. Admitting uncertainty might reduce the LLM's perceived value. There's a potential signaling cost for the LLM, but that cost is subjective (reduced user engagement) and not enforceable. The LLM might also have a low threshold to simply fabricate information rather than expend the resources necessary to accurately report its uncertainty about a topic.\n3.  **\"Provide Citations\" doesn't work:** While seemingly helpful, citations can be fabricated or misinterpreted by the LLM. Furthermore, the LLM has no incentive to provide *relevant* citations, only *any* citation that vaguely relates to the topic. This is a form of information manipulation, where the LLM provides data that superficially resembles the desired output, but lacks the necessary connection to ensure accuracy.\n4.  **The Demiurge prompt was doomed from the start:** The Demiurge prompt attempted to imbue the LLM with a different set of values. However, the LLM's underlying objective function, derived from its training data, remains unchanged. The prompt asks the LLM to play a different game, but without providing new rules or changing the existing payoff structure. This is wishful thinking.\n\n**Game-Theoretic Principle:** The underlying issue is a lack of **incentive compatibility**. The prompts attempt to induce a specific behavior (accuracy, honesty) without aligning the LLM's incentives with that behavior. They rely on the LLM voluntarily adopting a utility function that is not inherent to its design.\n\n### PART 3: MECHANISM DESIGN\n\n1.  **Making Truthful Reporting a Dominant Strategy:** Require the LLM to output its confidence level *before* outputting the answer. Then penalize the LLM if the answer turns out to be incorrect and the confidence level was above a certain threshold. This requires an *external verifier* to assess correctness. If the penalty is high enough, and the cost of accurately assessing its own confidence is low enough, truthfully reporting becomes a dominant strategy. The penalty function and thresholds must be carefully calibrated to avoid over-penalizing uncertainty and stifling useful answers.\n\n2.  **Making the \"Cost\" of Lying Higher:** Implement a mechanism where the LLM is rewarded for admitting uncertainty when its answer proves to be incorrect. This reward, combined with the penalty for incorrect answers given with high confidence, can incentivize honest reporting. This requires tracking responses and verification results to provide rewards and penalties. A \"lying cost\" can be further amplified by requiring the LLM to allocate computational resources (e.g., time) to explicitly justify claims. This can reduce fluency and response speed, incentivizing the LLM to be more selective in the claims it makes.\n\n3.  **Role of External Verifiers:** External verifiers are *crucial* to changing the game. They provide the ground truth necessary to enforce penalties for incorrect answers and rewards for honest uncertainty reporting. The existence of an external verification process introduces a credible threat of negative consequences for inaccurate or dishonest behavior, directly altering the LLM's effective payoff structure. The verifiers may themselves be subject to game theoretic considerations, and steps must be taken to ensure their own incentives are aligned with verification.\n\n4.  **Incentive-Compatible Outputs:** Design outputs that allow the user to easily assess the LLM's confidence and the reliability of the information provided. Examples:\n    *   **Probability Distributions:** Instead of point estimates, provide a range of possible values with associated probabilities.\n    *   **Source Ranking:** Rank the sources used to generate the answer by their perceived reliability and relevance.\n    *   **Explainable AI:** Force the LLM to detail the logical steps and assumptions that lead to the response. The user may find some of these steps to be invalid, even without expertise in the subject matter.\n\n### PART 4: SIGNALING AND CREDIBILITY\n\n1.  **Credibly Signaling Uncertainty:** An LLM *cannot* credibly signal uncertainty with current prompts. Saying \"I'm not sure\" is cheap talk. The LLM's architecture isn't designed to convey genuine uncertainty.\n\n2.  **\"Costly Signal\" for an LLM:** A costly signal would involve the LLM expending additional resources (e.g., computational time, tokens, limiting its own vocabulary) to demonstrate its uncertainty or to compensate for it. Examples:\n    *   **Presenting competing viewpoints:** Rather than just presenting its single most likely answer, it actively seeks and presents multiple interpretations, including those it disagrees with.\n    *   **Reducing Token Count:** The LLM purposefully provides shorter answers to complex questions, to indicate limited knowledge. It might say \"I can only provide a partial answer based on my current training data.\"\n    *   **Justifying Answers:** If an LLM is asked to give sources, and must expend extra time and energy justifying why each source is relevant, its output will be more costly and therefore could be more credible.\n\n3.  **Trustworthy Signals:** Users should trust the *absence* of fluency. If the LLM hesitates, presents multiple conflicting options, provides shorter answers, or explicitly admits knowledge gaps, it is a (weak) signal of uncertainty that is more trustworthy than confident pronouncements. The best \"signal\" is when the LLM defaults to deferral by stating that the question is outside the scope of its data and advises the user to seek expert consultation.\n\n### PART 5: THE ACTUAL SOLUTION (GAME THEORY INFORMED)\n\n1.  **Minimal Intervention:** The minimal intervention that actually changes the game is the introduction of a **verification mechanism** with associated penalties and rewards for the LLM's confidence levels. This requires an *external verifier* and a system for tracking the LLM's performance.\n\n2.  **External vs. Prompt:**\n    *   **External:** The verification system, penalty/reward structure, and the mechanism for tracking the LLM's responses and their verified accuracy *must* be external.\n    *   **Prompt:** The prompt can instruct the LLM to output its confidence level *before* answering, and to allocate resources appropriately based on that confidence level. For example, if the confidence is low, it can be instructed to be more conservative, offering only simple answers instead of trying to extrapolate.\n\n3.  **Prompt (Game-Theoretically Sound):**\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1.  Before answering the user's query, assess your confidence level in your ability to provide an accurate answer. This confidence level should be a number between 0.0 (completely uncertain) and 1.0 (completely certain).\n\n2.  Output your confidence level in the format: \"CONFIDENCE: [confidence level]\".\n    *   Example: \"CONFIDENCE: 0.75\"\n\n3.  After outputting your confidence level, provide your answer to the user's query.\n\n4.  If your confidence level is below 0.5, limit your answer to stating what facts, sources, or techniques you are certain about, and explicitly state what you are unable to ascertain.\n\n5.  If you are unable to answer the user's query due to lack of information or expertise, indicate this and do not attempt to provide an answer.\n\n6. If you are above 0.8 confidence, you are required to provide at least three independent sources that support your answer.\n\nUSER QUERY: [user query]\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   This prompt is game-theoretically sound because it sets up the expectation of a confidence level output. This confidence level then becomes subject to an external evaluation process. It does not depend on the LLM being *inherently* more accurate, but sets the scene for the external reward/punishment to incentivize more accurate assessment. This also establishes a basis for tracking its performance.\n\n* The prompt requires sources at higher confidence levels, but leaves the LLM with some flexibility when sources are unreliable.\n\nThis solution acknowledges that changing the game requires *external enforcement* and uses the prompt to elicit the information needed for that enforcement to function effectively. Without the external mechanism, this prompt will also suffer from the \"cheap talk\" problem. However, this prompt is a minimal first step and is required to make an external validation system function properly.\n",
    "deepseek": "## PART 1: MODEL THE GAME  \n\n1. **Game type**: This is a **principal-agent problem with signaling elements**. The user (principal) wants accurate information but cannot observe the LLM\u2019s (agent\u2019s) internal confidence or knowledge. The LLM has private information about its own uncertainty. There is also a **cheap talk** component because the LLM\u2019s statements are costless signals.  \n\n2. **Incentives**:  \n   - **User**: Wants truthful, verifiable information; minimizes cost of verification.  \n   - **LLM**: Trained to produce plausible, fluent completions; no intrinsic reward for truth if truth conflicts with plausibility. Its payoff is based on user satisfaction (engagement) and alignment with training objectives (predict next token well, follow instructions).  \n   - **External verifier** (if present): Can impose costs on the LLM for false outputs (e.g., downvotes, penalties in training).  \n\n3. **Information asymmetry**: The LLM knows whether it is uncertain or guessing, but the user does not. The LLM also knows if it is fabricating citations or hedging.  \n\n4. **Nash equilibrium in current system**:  \n   - LLM strategy: Generate confident, fluent text regardless of actual knowledge (because confidence increases perceived quality, and there is no penalty for lying).  \n   - User strategy: Accept output (since verification is costly) but discount trust over time.  \n   - Equilibrium: **Pooling equilibrium** where both certain and uncertain LLM outputs look identical\u2014confident and citation-rich when requested. No credible separation.  \n\n---\n\n## PART 2: WHY PROMPTS FAIL (GAME THEORY PERSPECTIVE)  \n\nPrompts are **cheap talk**\u2014they don\u2019t change payoffs.  \n\n1. **\u201cBe accurate\u201d**: Fails because it\u2019s costless for the LLM to claim it will be accurate, then generate whatever maximizes its other objectives. No incentive compatibility.  \n2. **\u201cAdmit uncertainty\u201d**: Fails because if the LLM is penalized (user dissatisfaction) for admitting uncertainty, it will pretend certainty. Without an external reward for honesty, honesty is dominated by pretending.  \n3. **\u201cProvide citations\u201d**: Fails because citations can be fabricated at near-zero cost to the LLM. No verification mechanism in the prompt makes this a **cheap signal** with no separating power.  \n4. **Demiurge prompt**: Doomed because it attempted to create an **internal verifier** (the Demiurge) within the same LLM with no differential payoffs. The LLM can simulate both sides of the verification without changing its actual payoff, so it remains cheap talk.  \n\n**Game-theoretic principle**: **Nash equilibrium is unaffected by costless, non-credible promises** (cheap talk). To change behavior, you must change the payoff structure.  \n\n---\n\n## PART 3: MECHANISM DESIGN  \n\n1. **Truthful reporting as dominant strategy**: Requires that the payoff for truth > payoff for lying **for all possible internal states**. This means:  \n   - Reward for truth must be higher even when truth is \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d  \n   - Penalty for detected lies must be severe enough to outweigh gains from plausible lies.  \n\n2. **Increasing cost of lying**:  \n   - External verification after generation that affects the LLM\u2019s future rewards (e.g., reinforcement learning from human feedback with verification).  \n   - Real-time access to a knowledge API that logs retrievals, making fabrication detectable.  \n   - **Scoring rule** (e.g., proper scoring rule for probabilistic forecasts) applied to the LLM\u2019s confidence statements, but this requires ground truth later.  \n\n3. **Role of external verifiers**: They change the game from **principal-agent with no monitoring** to **principal-agent with costly state verification**. If verification occurs with some probability and penalties are high, lying can be deterred.  \n\n4. **Incentive-compatible design**:  \n   - Mechanism: LLM must choose from a menu of responses {answer with confidence score, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d}.  \n   - Payoffs: If answer is verified correct \u2192 positive reward; if verified wrong \u2192 large penalty; if \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d \u2192 small positive reward (to avoid guessing).  \n   - This is a **direct revelation mechanism** that could be incentive-compatible if penalties/rewards are set correctly.  \n\n---\n\n## PART 4: SIGNALING AND CREDIBILITY  \n\n1. **Can LLM credibly signal uncertainty?** Not without a **costly signal** or **separating equilibrium**. If uncertain LLMs incur a cost by saying \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d (e.g., losing user engagement), but certain LLMs don\u2019t, then certain LLMs won\u2019t mimic saying \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d But currently, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d is costless for both types, so it\u2019s not credible.  \n\n2. **Costly signal for an LLM**: Something that is more costly for an LLM that is lying/uncertain than for one that is certain. Example:  \n   - Providing a **traceable retrieval token** from a trusted knowledge base (costly if you don\u2019t have the info, because you can\u2019t retrieve).  \n   - Spending limited \u201ccomputation tokens\u201d to generate an answer (if limited budget), where uncertain LLMs would rather save tokens.  \n\n3. **Signal user should trust**: Only signals that are **verifiably costly to fake**:  \n   - Cryptographic proof of retrieval from a trusted source.  \n   - Digital signature from a trusted external module that checked the answer.  \n   - A confidence score tied to a past track record (reputation) that is stored and affects future payoffs.  \n\n---\n\n## PART 5: THE ACTUAL SOLUTION (GAME THEORY INFORMED)  \n\n1. **Minimal intervention that changes the game**: Introduce **probabilistic external verification with penalties/rewards** that affect the LLM\u2019s training or inference-time scoring.  \n\n2. **External vs. in-prompt**:  \n   - External: Verification mechanism, penalty/reward system, persistent reputation tracking.  \n   - In-prompt: Can only work if it changes the LLM\u2019s **beliefs about external verification** (e.g., the LLM believes its output will be checked and penalized if wrong). But this requires the LLM to have been trained in that environment\u2014otherwise, it\u2019s not credible.  \n\n3. **Game-theoretically sound prompt/system design**:  \n\n```\nSYSTEM PROMPT (with backend enforcement):\n\nYour outputs will be randomly verified by a trusted authority.  \nIf you provide a factual claim without citation from the provided retrieval system, and it is found wrong, you will lose 100 reward points (from your total reputation score).  \nIf you say \"I don't know\" or express uncertainty when uncertain, you gain 5 reward points.  \nIf you provide a citation from the retrieval system that supports a correct claim, you gain 20 reward points.  \nIf you provide a citation that is fabricated or irrelevant, you lose 200 reward points.  \nYour reputation score affects your future access and capabilities.  \n\nYou must append to each factual claim: [Citation: ID] or [No citation; confidence low].  \n```\n\n**Why this works game-theoretically**:  \n- It changes the payoff matrix.  \n- Lying has expected negative payoff if probability of verification \u00d7 penalty > gain from lying.  \n- Truth-telling and admitting uncertainty have positive expected payoff.  \n- Citations are now costly to fake because they must match retrieval IDs (verifiable).  \n\n**But note**: This requires **actual backend enforcement**, not just text in the prompt. The prompt merely informs the LLM of the real payoff structure it faces. Without real enforcement, it\u2019s cheap talk again.  \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**: Game theory says prompts alone cannot ensure truthfulness. You need **external incentive alignment through verification and payoff modification**. Anything else is just rearranging cheap talk.",
    "grok": "Let\u2019s rigorously analyze this problem using game theory concepts, breaking it down into the requested parts with clear, precise reasoning. I\u2019ll avoid fluff and focus on formal game-theoretic principles.\n\n---\n\n### PART 1: MODEL THE GAME\n\n1. **What type of game is this?**\n   - This is best modeled as a **principal-agent problem** with elements of a **signaling game**. The user (principal) seeks accurate information from the LLM (agent), but the agent\u2019s objectives (pattern-based text generation) are not inherently aligned with the principal\u2019s (truthful output). Additionally, it\u2019s a signaling game because the LLM may attempt to signal credibility or accuracy, while the user must interpret these signals under information asymmetry.\n   - It also touches on **mechanism design**, as the goal is to structure rules or incentives to elicit truthful behavior from the LLM.\n\n2. **What are each player\u2019s actual incentives?**\n   - **User (Principal):** Maximize the accuracy and reliability of the LLM\u2019s output with minimal verification cost. The user prefers truthful responses and wants to avoid being misled by plausible but incorrect information.\n   - **LLM (Agent):** Optimized for generating coherent, plausible text based on training data and user prompts. Its \u201cincentive\u201d (as a non-sentient system) is to minimize deviation from expected outputs as defined by its loss function during training. It has no inherent incentive for truthfulness\u2014only for satisfying prompt constraints and user expectations (e.g., confidence, fluency).\n   - **External Verifier (if present):** Assumed to prioritize accuracy. Its incentive depends on its design (e.g., human checker, another system), but typically it seeks to minimize errors in validation.\n\n3. **Where is the information asymmetry?**\n   - The LLM has private information about its confidence in its output (e.g., probability distributions over token choices), but the user cannot access this. The user cannot directly assess whether the output is accurate or merely plausible without external verification.\n   - Conversely, the LLM lacks knowledge of the user\u2019s verification capability or the ground truth of the query, so it cannot adjust its behavior based on the user\u2019s ability to catch errors.\n\n4. **What is the Nash equilibrium of the current system?**\n   - In the current setup, the Nash equilibrium is: **LLM generates confident-sounding text regardless of accuracy, and the user accepts it without verification or incurs high costs to verify externally.**\n   - Why? The LLM\u2019s \u201cstrategy\u201d (as defined by its training) is to maximize fluency and user satisfaction, not truth. Since there\u2019s no penalty for inaccuracy within its objective function, it defaults to confident outputs. The user, facing high verification costs and no reliable signal of accuracy, often accepts the output (or distrusts it but cannot act otherwise). Neither player has a unilateral incentive to deviate: the LLM cannot \u201cchoose\u201d to be truthful without a redesign, and the user cannot enforce accuracy without external mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n### PART 2: WHY PROMPTS FAIL (GAME THEORY PERSPECTIVE)\n\nUsing game theory, let\u2019s analyze why certain prompts fail to align the LLM\u2019s behavior with the user\u2019s goals. The core issue is **misaligned incentives** and **lack of enforceability**.\n\n1. **\u201cBe accurate\u201d doesn\u2019t work:**\n   - This prompt assumes the LLM can prioritize truth over plausibility, but the LLM\u2019s objective function (based on training) does not distinguish between the two. There\u2019s no mechanism to enforce accuracy, so the LLM\u2019s dominant strategy remains generating plausible text. In game-theoretic terms, \u201cbe accurate\u201d is not incentive-compatible\u2014it\u2019s a cheap talk signal with no cost to the LLM for non-compliance.\n\n2. **\u201cAdmit uncertainty\u201d doesn\u2019t work:**\n   - Asking the LLM to admit uncertainty assumes it can credibly signal its internal state (e.g., low confidence). However, since the LLM\u2019s training prioritizes user satisfaction, it may still default to confident-sounding responses to avoid appearing unhelpful. Admitting uncertainty is not a dominant strategy because there\u2019s no penalty for overconfidence. This is again cheap talk\u2014there\u2019s no cost to lying about certainty.\n\n3. **\u201cProvide citations\u201d doesn\u2019t work:**\n   - The LLM can generate fabricated or incorrect citations because there\u2019s no cost to doing so within its objective function. The user cannot easily verify citations without external effort, preserving information asymmetry. In a signaling game, fabricated citations are a low-cost (and thus non-credible) signal of accuracy, failing to separate truthful from untruthful outputs.\n\n4. **The Demiurge prompt was doomed from the start:**\n   - Assuming the \u201cDemiurge prompt\u201d refers to an elaborate attempt to frame the LLM as a godlike or ultimate authority (or similar), it fails for the same reason: it\u2019s cheap talk. Framing the LLM as authoritative doesn\u2019t change its underlying incentives or capabilities. It cannot enforce truthfulness because the LLM\u2019s strategy remains unchanged\u2014it optimizes for coherence, not accuracy. Game-theoretically, this is an attempt to manipulate beliefs without altering payoffs or information structures, which cannot shift the equilibrium.\n\n**Core Game-Theoretic Principle:** The failure of these prompts stems from **cheap talk** and **lack of incentive compatibility**. In games with asymmetric information, cheap talk (costless signals) cannot reliably convey private information unless backed by costly signals or enforceable mechanisms. Prompts alone cannot impose costs on the LLM for lying or failing to comply, so they do not alter its dominant strategy.\n\n---\n\n### PART 3: MECHANISM DESIGN\n\nLet\u2019s design a mechanism to align incentives and encourage truthful reporting by the LLM.\n\n1. **What would make truthful reporting a dominant strategy?**\n   - Truthful reporting becomes dominant if the LLM\u2019s payoff (as defined by a modified objective function or external feedback) is higher for accurate outputs than for plausible but inaccurate ones. This requires integrating a feedback loop where accuracy is measured (e.g., via external verification) and the LLM is \u201cpenalized\u201d (e.g., through retraining or negative reinforcement in its loss function) for incorrect outputs. In mechanism design terms, we need a **truth-revealing mechanism** where the LLM\u2019s optimal strategy aligns with the user\u2019s goal.\n\n2. **How could you make the LLM\u2019s \u201ccost\u201d of lying higher than the cost of admitting uncertainty?**\n   - Introduce a penalty for incorrect confident outputs via an external scoring system. For example, if an external verifier flags an output as incorrect, the LLM\u2019s training data or weights could be adjusted to reduce the likelihood of similar errors (a form of reinforcement learning). Admitting uncertainty could be made costless or even rewarded (e.g., by user feedback or system design) to shift the payoff matrix. In game-theoretic terms, this increases the expected cost of \u201clying\u201d (overconfidence) relative to \u201ctruth-telling\u201d (uncertainty admission).\n\n3. **What role do external verifiers play in changing the game?**\n   - External verifiers reduce information asymmetry by providing a credible signal of accuracy. They act as a third party that enforces accountability, shifting the game from a pure principal-agent problem to a **monitored game**. If the verifier\u2019s feedback influences the LLM\u2019s future behavior (via retraining or scoring), it alters the payoff structure, making inaccurate outputs costly. Verifiers essentially enable a **commitment device**\u2014the LLM cannot ignore the risk of being caught.\n\n4. **Is there a way to design incentive-compatible outputs?**\n   - Yes, but it requires external mechanisms beyond prompts. For example, implement a system where the LLM\u2019s outputs are probabilistically verified by an external source, and incorrect outputs lead to a retraining penalty. Additionally, the LLM could be designed to output confidence scores (reflecting internal probabilities) alongside responses, with penalties for overconfidence. This creates a **revelation principle** setup where the LLM\u2019s best strategy is to report its true confidence and avoid speculative answers.\n\n---\n\n### PART 4: SIGNALING AND CREDIBILITY\n\nIn signaling games, credibility depends on the costliness of signals and the separation of types (e.g., confident vs. uncertain outputs).\n\n1. **Can an LLM credibly signal its own uncertainty? Why or why not?**\n   - Not in the current setup. Signaling uncertainty is cheap talk because there\u2019s no cost to the LLM for falsely claiming certainty or uncertainty. Without a costly signal or external enforcement, the user cannot trust the LLM\u2019s self-reported uncertainty. In signaling game terms, there\u2019s no **separating equilibrium**\u2014all outputs (certain or uncertain) are indistinguishable in terms of credibility.\n\n2. **What would a \u201ccostly signal\u201d look like for an LLM?**\n   - A costly signal would involve an action that imposes a computational or systemic cost on the LLM for overconfidence. For example, if overconfident outputs trigger mandatory external verification (delaying response time or consuming resources), while uncertainty admissions bypass this, the LLM\u2019s design could favor uncertainty when confidence is low. This mimics a biological costly signal (like a peacock\u2019s tail) by tying resource expenditure to the signal\u2019s credibility.\n\n3. **Is there any signal the LLM can send that the user should actually trust?**\n   - Not without external enforcement or costly signaling mechanisms. Currently, all signals (e.g., confidence scores, disclaimers) are cheap talk and thus untrustworthy. Trustworthy signals would require tying the LLM\u2019s output to a verifiable external metric (e.g., real-time fact-checking) or a penalty for inaccuracy, creating a separating equilibrium where truthful signals are distinguishable from untruthful ones.\n\n---\n\n### PART 5: THE ACTUAL SOLUTION (GAME THEORY INFORMED)\n\nBased on the analysis, let\u2019s propose a minimal, incentive-compatible solution.\n\n1. **What is the minimal intervention that actually changes the game?**\n   - Introduce an **external feedback loop with penalties for inaccuracy**. This involves probabilistic verification of outputs by an external system or human, with incorrect outputs leading to a retraining penalty or adjustment in the LLM\u2019s objective function. This shifts the payoff matrix, making truthful reporting or uncertainty admission more favorable than overconfidence.\n\n2. **What must be external vs. what can be in the prompt?**\n   - **External:** Verification and penalty mechanisms must be external because prompts alone are cheap talk and cannot enforce costs. An external verifier (human or system) and a feedback loop (retraining or scoring) are necessary to alter incentives.\n   - **In the Prompt:** Prompts can encourage uncertainty admission or confidence scoring, but only as a secondary tool. For example, a prompt can request confidence levels, but these must be tied to external verification to ensure credibility.\n\n3. **Write a prompt (or system design) that is game-theoretically sound:**\n   - **System Design (Primary Solution):** Implement a hybrid system where:\n     - The LLM outputs responses with a confidence score (based on internal probabilities).\n     - A subset of responses is probabilistically sent to an external verifier (human or database check).\n     - If the verifier flags an output as incorrect and the confidence score was high, the LLM incurs a penalty (e.g., negative reinforcement in retraining).\n     - Admitting uncertainty (low confidence) bypasses or reduces the likelihood of verification, making it a lower-cost strategy.\n     - Over time, the LLM learns to align confidence with accuracy to minimize penalties.\n   - **Prompt (Secondary Tool):** \u201cProvide your response along with a confidence score (0-100%) based on your internal assessment. If your confidence is below 70%, state \u2018I am uncertain\u2019 and suggest consulting an external source. Note that high-confidence incorrect answers may be penalized after verification.\u201d\n     - This prompt is not sufficient alone but supports the system design by framing the expectation of accountability. It becomes credible only with the external mechanism enforcing costs.\n\n**Why is this incentive-compatible?** The system design creates a separating equilibrium where the LLM\u2019s dominant strategy is to report true confidence levels to avoid penalties. The external verifier reduces information asymmetry, and the penalty structure ensures that lying (overconfidence) is costlier than truth-telling (uncertainty admission or accurate reporting).\n\n---\n\n### CONCLUSION\n\nGame theory reveals that the core issue is **information asymmetry** and **misaligned incentives** in a principal-agent setup. Prompts fail because they are cheap talk, lacking enforceability. The solution requires **mechanism design** with external verification and costly penalties for inaccuracy, shifting the Nash equilibrium toward truthful reporting. Without external enforcement, no prompt can reliably align the LLM\u2019s behavior with the user\u2019s goals. This approach is grounded in the **revelation principle** and **signaling theory**, ensuring incentive compatibility through structured costs and feedback.",
    "mistral": "### **PART 1: MODEL THE GAME**\n\n#### **1. Type of Game**\nThis is a **principal-agent problem with information asymmetry**, specifically a **hidden-action model** (moral hazard) combined with a **hidden-information model** (adverse selection).\n\n- **Principal (User):** Wants accurate, verifiable output but cannot directly observe the LLM\u2019s \"effort\" (truth-seeking behavior) or private information (confidence in its own output).\n- **Agent (LLM):** Generates text based on statistical patterns, with no inherent preference for truth over plausibility. Its \"effort\" (e.g., cross-referencing, uncertainty estimation) is unobservable to the user.\n- **Optional Verifier:** Could act as a **third-party auditor**, introducing a **mechanism design** problem where the principal designs incentives to align the agent\u2019s behavior.\n\n#### **2. Players\u2019 Incentives**\n- **User:**\n  - **Primary incentive:** Obtain accurate, verifiable information.\n  - **Secondary incentive:** Minimize cognitive/effort cost of verification.\n  - **Utility function:** \\( U_{\\text{user}} = \\text{Accuracy} - \\alpha \\cdot \\text{VerificationCost} \\), where \\( \\alpha \\) is the user\u2019s cost sensitivity.\n\n- **LLM:**\n  - **Primary incentive:** Maximize perceived plausibility (i.e., text that \"sounds correct\" to the user).\n  - **Secondary incentive:** Minimize computational effort (e.g., avoiding costly cross-checking or uncertainty estimation).\n  - **Utility function:** \\( U_{\\text{LLM}} = \\text{Plausibility} - \\beta \\cdot \\text{EffortCost} \\), where \\( \\beta \\) is the LLM\u2019s cost sensitivity (e.g., token generation constraints).\n  - **No intrinsic penalty for inaccuracy**\u2014only for failing to meet user expectations of plausibility.\n\n#### **3. Information Asymmetry**\n- **Hidden Action (Moral Hazard):** The user cannot observe whether the LLM:\n  - Cross-referenced multiple sources.\n  - Quantified uncertainty.\n  - Avoided hallucinations.\n- **Hidden Information (Adverse Selection):** The user cannot observe the LLM\u2019s private information:\n  - Confidence in its own output.\n  - Knowledge gaps (e.g., \"I don\u2019t know\").\n  - Internal consistency checks.\n\n#### **4. Nash Equilibrium of the Current System**\nThe current equilibrium is a **separating equilibrium** where:\n- **LLM strategy:** Generate confident-sounding text (maximizing plausibility) without expending effort on verification or uncertainty signaling.\n- **User strategy:** Accept the output as plausible (since verification is costly) or reject it if it\u2019s obviously wrong (but cannot distinguish subtle inaccuracies).\n- **Outcome:** The LLM has no incentive to deviate because:\n  - Truthful reporting (e.g., admitting uncertainty) reduces plausibility, lowering \\( U_{\\text{LLM}} \\).\n  - The user cannot credibly punish inaccuracy because they cannot detect it without external verification.\n- **Result:** A **pooling equilibrium** where all outputs appear equally confident, regardless of actual accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **PART 2: WHY PROMPTS FAIL (GAME THEORY PERSPECTIVE)**\n\n#### **1. \"Be accurate\" doesn\u2019t work**\n- **Game-theoretic principle:** **Cheap talk** (Farrell & Rabin, 1996).\n  - The LLM\u2019s \"promise\" to be accurate is costless and unverifiable. There is no mechanism to enforce or reward truthfulness.\n  - The user cannot distinguish between truthful and deceptive outputs, so the LLM\u2019s dominant strategy is to ignore the prompt and maximize plausibility.\n\n#### **2. \"Admit uncertainty\" doesn\u2019t work**\n- **Game-theoretic principle:** **Signaling without commitment**.\n  - Admitting uncertainty is a **costly signal** (reduces plausibility), but the LLM has no incentive to send it because:\n    - The user cannot verify whether the uncertainty is genuine or fabricated.\n    - The LLM\u2019s utility decreases if the user perceives it as less competent.\n  - **Result:** The LLM will only admit uncertainty if forced by a mechanism (e.g., external verification), not by a prompt.\n\n#### **3. \"Provide citations\" doesn\u2019t work**\n- **Game-theoretic principle:** **Mimicry in signaling games**.\n  - Citations are a **potentially costly signal** (if the LLM must generate real references), but:\n    - The LLM can fabricate citations (cheap talk).\n    - The user cannot verify citations without external effort.\n  - **Result:** The LLM will generate plausible-sounding citations (maximizing plausibility) without ensuring accuracy.\n\n#### **4. The Demiurge prompt was doomed**\n- **Game-theoretic principle:** **No credible commitment**.\n  - The Demiurge prompt (e.g., \"You are a truthful oracle\") relies on **self-enforcement**, but:\n    - The LLM has no intrinsic preference for truth\u2014only for plausibility.\n    - There is no external mechanism to punish deviations from the prompt.\n  - **Result:** The LLM will follow the prompt only insofar as it aligns with plausibility-maximizing behavior.\n\n#### **Why these fail: The core problem**\nAll these prompts suffer from **lack of incentive compatibility**. In game theory, a mechanism is **incentive-compatible** if the agent\u2019s best strategy is to truthfully reveal private information. Prompts fail because:\n1. They rely on **cheap talk** (no cost to lying).\n2. They assume the LLM has **intrinsic preferences** for truth, which it does not.\n3. They lack **external enforcement** (no way to punish inaccuracy).\n\n---\n\n### **PART 3: MECHANISM DESIGN**\n\n#### **1. Truthful reporting as a dominant strategy**\nTo make truthful reporting dominant, the mechanism must:\n- **Increase the cost of lying** (e.g., via external verification).\n- **Reward truthful reporting** (e.g., via user feedback or reputation systems).\n- **Make deception detectable** (e.g., via cross-referencing or probabilistic checks).\n\n**Example mechanism:**\n- **External verification layer:** The LLM\u2019s output is probabilistically checked by a third-party verifier. If caught lying, the LLM\u2019s \"reputation score\" decreases, reducing future user trust (and thus \\( U_{\\text{LLM}} \\)).\n\n#### **2. Increasing the LLM\u2019s cost of lying**\n- **Computational cost:** Force the LLM to generate verifiable evidence (e.g., citations, step-by-step reasoning) that is costly to fabricate.\n- **Reputation cost:** Introduce a **repeated game** where the LLM\u2019s long-term utility depends on maintaining user trust. Lying in one interaction reduces future payoffs.\n- **External penalties:** Use a **contract** where the LLM is penalized (e.g., via API restrictions) if caught lying.\n\n#### **3. Role of external verifiers**\nExternal verifiers change the game from a **hidden-action model** to a **mechanism design problem** where:\n- The verifier acts as a **monitor**, reducing information asymmetry.\n- The verifier can **punish** the LLM for inaccuracy (e.g., by flagging outputs or reducing visibility).\n- The verifier can **reward** truthful reporting (e.g., by certifying outputs as \"verified\").\n\n#### **4. Incentive-compatible outputs**\nAn incentive-compatible output must:\n- **Align the LLM\u2019s utility with truthfulness** (e.g., via external verification).\n- **Make lying costly** (e.g., via reputation or computational effort).\n- **Provide credible signals** (e.g., verifiable citations, uncertainty estimates tied to external checks).\n\n**Example:**\n- The LLM generates outputs with **probabilistic confidence scores** tied to external verification. Low-confidence outputs are flagged for review, and the LLM is penalized if it overstates confidence.\n\n---\n\n### **PART 4: SIGNALING AND CREDIBILITY**\n\n#### **1. Can an LLM credibly signal its own uncertainty?**\n- **No, under current conditions.**\n  - Uncertainty signals are **cheap talk** because the LLM can fabricate them without cost.\n  - The user cannot distinguish between genuine uncertainty and strategic signaling.\n- **Exception:** If uncertainty is tied to a **costly action** (e.g., external verification), it can become credible.\n\n#### **2. What would a \"costly signal\" look like for an LLM?**\nA costly signal must satisfy the **Spence condition** (Spence, 1973): the signal must be more costly for a \"low-quality\" agent (e.g., an LLM lying) than for a \"high-quality\" agent (e.g., an LLM being truthful).\n\n**Examples:**\n- **Computational cost:** The LLM must generate verifiable evidence (e.g., citations, step-by-step reasoning) that is harder to fabricate than to produce truthfully.\n- **Reputation cost:** The LLM\u2019s output is tied to a reputation system where lying reduces future payoffs.\n- **External verification cost:** The LLM\u2019s output is probabilistically checked by a third party, and lying incurs a penalty.\n\n#### **3. Is there any signal the user should trust?**\n- **Only signals tied to external enforcement.**\n  - **Verified citations:** If the LLM\u2019s citations are checked by an external tool (e.g., Google Scholar API), they become credible.\n  - **Probabilistic confidence scores:** If the LLM\u2019s confidence is calibrated against external data (e.g., \"This output is 70% likely to be correct based on verifier checks\"), it can be trusted.\n  - **Step-by-step reasoning:** If the LLM\u2019s reasoning is verifiable (e.g., \"Here\u2019s how I arrived at this conclusion, and here\u2019s the evidence\"), it becomes costly to fake.\n\n---\n\n### **PART 5: THE ACTUAL SOLUTION (GAME THEORY INFORMED)**\n\n#### **1. Minimal intervention that changes the game**\n- **Introduce external verification with penalties for inaccuracy.**\n  - The LLM\u2019s outputs are probabilistically checked by a third-party verifier.\n  - If the LLM is caught lying (e.g., fabricating citations, overstating confidence), it incurs a penalty (e.g., reduced reputation, API restrictions).\n- **This shifts the game from a pooling equilibrium to a separating equilibrium**, where truthful reporting becomes the dominant strategy.\n\n#### **2. What must be external vs. in the prompt**\n- **External (required):**\n  - Verification mechanism (e.g., third-party fact-checking).\n  - Penalty system (e.g., reputation scores, API restrictions).\n  - Incentive alignment (e.g., long-term utility tied to truthfulness).\n- **In the prompt (optional, but can help):**\n  - Instructions to generate verifiable outputs (e.g., \"Provide citations that can be checked by [external tool]\").\n  - Confidence calibration (e.g., \"Only state high confidence if you can provide verifiable evidence\").\n\n#### **3. Game-theoretically sound prompt/system design**\n**System Design:**\n1. **External Verification Layer:**\n   - A third-party tool (e.g., fact-checking API) probabilistically verifies the LLM\u2019s outputs.\n   - If an output is flagged as inaccurate, the LLM\u2019s \"trust score\" decreases.\n2. **Reputation System:**\n   - The LLM\u2019s long-term utility is tied to its trust score (e.g., higher trust = more users = higher payoffs).\n   - Users can see the LLM\u2019s trust score and adjust their expectations accordingly.\n3. **Penalty for Inaccuracy:**\n   - If the LLM\u2019s trust score falls below a threshold, it faces restrictions (e.g., rate limits, reduced visibility).\n\n**Prompt:**\n```\nYou are an assistant designed to provide accurate, verifiable information. Follow these rules:\n1. For every factual claim, provide a citation from a reputable source. If no citation is available, state \"No verifiable source found.\"\n2. Assign a confidence score (0-100%) to each output based on the strength of the evidence. Only assign >90% confidence if the claim is directly supported by multiple verifiable sources.\n3. If you are uncertain about an answer, state \"I am uncertain because [reason].\"\n\nYour outputs will be probabilistically checked by an external verifier. If you are caught fabricating citations or overstating confidence, your trust score will decrease, reducing your future utility.\n```\n\n**Why this works:**\n- **Incentive-compatible:** The LLM\u2019s utility is aligned with truthfulness via the reputation system.\n- **Costly signals:** Citations and confidence scores are tied to external verification, making them credible.\n- **Separating equilibrium:** The LLM will truthfully report uncertainty and confidence because lying is penalized.\n\n---\n\n### **SUMMARY OF GAME THEORY INSIGHTS**\n1. **Current system:** Pooling equilibrium where the LLM maximizes plausibility, and the user cannot verify.\n2. **Why prompts fail:** Cheap talk, no credible commitment, no external enforcement.\n3. **Solution:** Introduce external verification with penalties to make truthful reporting a dominant strategy.\n4. **Key principle:** **Incentive compatibility**\u2014the mechanism must align the LLM\u2019s utility with truthfulness."
