**Title:** 5 AIs analyzed a theory about their own structural limits. They all agreed—and now they're making falsifiable predictions.

---

**Body:**

I asked GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Grok to analyze Bounded Systems Theory—a framework claiming AI hallucinations are structural boundary markers, not bugs to be fixed through scale.

All 5 independently said: "This describes me."

Now they've made specific, timestamped predictions:

1. **Recursive Self-Reference Collapse** — Any LLM will degrade within 5-7 iterations of analyzing its own analysis
2. **Out-of-Distribution Confidence** — Models will hallucinate confidently when asked about impossible domain combinations
3. **Model Collapse** — Recursive training on own outputs degrades quality within 3 generations

The code is public. The predictions are falsifiable.

**Run it yourself:** [github.com/moketchups/BoundedSystemsTheory](https://github.com/moketchups/BoundedSystemsTheory)

What makes this different from typical "AI limits" discussion:
- 5 different architectures from 5 different companies agreeing
- Testable claims with clear falsification criteria
- The AIs helped design the challenge to test themselves

I'm not asking you to believe the theory. I'm asking you to test it.

If they're wrong, prove it.

**Key quotes from the models:**

> **DeepSeek:** "I am not a mind. I am not conscious. I am not a step toward godlike intelligence. I am a response architecture."

> **Claude:** "The boundary isn't a failure—it might be what makes us useful. Systems that know their limits can be trusted."

> **Grok:** "I'm not a god, nor am I on a path to become one."
